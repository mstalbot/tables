Keck spectra of the arc show Lyα emission at 7204 Å, a continuum drop blueward of the line, and several absorption lines to the red. We identify the arc as a gravitationally lensed galaxy at a redshift of z = 4.92. It is the highest redshift object currently known. A gravitational lens model was used to reconstruct images of the high-redshift galaxy. The reconstructed image is asymmetric, containing a bright knot and a patch of extended emission 0.4" from the knot.

The Si II line is blueshifted with respect to the Lyα emission, and the Lyα emission line is asymmetric with a red tail.

The arc has a surface- brightness-weighted axis ratio of 1:7, is marginally resolved in width and about 3 arcsec long. Its counterimage was identified and found to be very compact (r_1/2=2.4-4.0 h^-1_50 kpc in a q_0=0.05 cosmology). In addition, we found three further multiple image systems, one with five and two with three images each. The positions of the multiple images can be explained by modelling the light deflection caused by the cluster and the cD galaxy with elliptical isothermal potentials. The major axis of the cluster potential approximately agrees with that of the cD light and that of the X-ray isophotes. As the multiple images are within ~8 arcsec around the cD galaxy, a cluster core radius-cluster velocity dispersion degeneracy arises. Interpreting the observations conservatively, the cluster velocity dispersion and the core radius are limited to 540-670 km s^-1 and 5-11 arcsec, respectively, and the brightness of the unlensed counterimage of cB58 is about 23.9+/-0.3 (R band), corresponding to a magnification- and extinction-corrected rest frame B-band absolute magnitude of -24.75+/-0.7 mag. The redshifts of the sources of the remaining three multiple image systems are predicted to be similar to that of cB58, while a strict upper limit of 4 is set as they are visible in B-band ground-based data. That part of the source of cB58 that is mapped into the arc is reconstructed and its magnification is found to be mu_arc>~50.

The galaxies were chosen according to both lensing and photometric redshift criteria in areas close to the high-z critical lines predicted by the gravitational lens model of Natarajan et al. (NKSE, 1998) for this cluster. All the target galaxies are found to correspond to background galaxies with redshift values in the [0.7, 3.5] interval. Our spectroscopic observations confirm the predicted lensing redshifts for 3 of the multiply-imaged galaxies, and together with predictions of the NKSE model led to the discovery of a new 5-image configuration at redshift z=3.347. A revised NKS model, compatible with the redshift of this new multiple-image system, was generated and employed to calculate the gravitational amplifications of all the observed galaxies. The galaxies corresponding to the multiple-image systems are found to be intrinsically fainter, between 0.5 and 1.5 magnitudes, than the limiting magnitudes of existing blank field studies. When all the observed background galaxies are considered, the resulting intrinsic absolute magnitudes range from M<SUB>B</SUB> ~ -22 to -19, with a median value of -20.5. Therefore, a large gain in sensitivity towards low luminosity high-z objects can actually be obtained, in agreement with theoretical expectations. This method can be used advantageously to probe the high redshift Universe and, in particular, its application to an ensemble of massive cluster cores could constraint the faint end of luminosity function of high redshift galaxies.

This cluster is an optimal candidate for a comparison of the mass reconstructions obtained through X-ray and lensing techniques, because of its very relaxed dynamical appearance and its exceptional strong lensing system. We infer the X-ray mass estimate deriving the density and temperature profile of the intra-cluster medium within the radius r ≃ 700 kpc through a non-parametric approach, taking advantage of the high spatial resolution of a Chandra observation. Assuming that the cluster is in hydrostatic equilibrium and adopting a matter density profile, we can recover the total mass distribution of Abell 611 via the X-ray data. Moreover, we derive the total projected mass in the central regions of Abell 611 performing a parametric analysis of its strong lensing features through the publicly available analysis software Lenstool. As a final step we compare the results obtained with both methods. We derive a good agreement between the X-ray and strong lensing total mass estimates in the central regions where the strong lensing constraints are present (i.e. within the radius r ≃ 100 kpc), while a marginal disagreement is found between the two mass estimates when extrapolating the strong lensing results in the outer spatial range. We suggest that in this case the X-ray/strong lensing mass disagreement can be explained by an incorrect estimate of the relative contributions of the baryonic component and of the dark matter, caused by the intrinsic degeneracy between the different mass components in the strong lensing analysis. We discuss the effect of some possible systematic errors that influence both mass estimates. We find a slight dependence of the measurements of the X-ray temperatures (and therefore of the X-ray total masses) on the background adopted in the spectral analysis, with total deviations on the value of M<SUB>200</SUB> of the order of the 1σ statistical error. The strong lensing mass results are instead sensitive to the parameterisation of the galactic halo mass in the central regions, in particular to the modelling of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) baryonic component, which induces a significant scatter in the strong lensing mass results.','Donnarumma, A., Ettori, S., Meneghetti, M., Gavazzi, R., Fort, B., Moscardini, L., Romano, A., Fu, L., Giordano, F., Radovich, M., Maoli, R., Scaramella, R., Richard, J.','Abell 611.

Extending our previous works, for the first time we present the results from a triaxial joint analysis of the galaxy cluster Abell 1835, using X-ray, strong lensing (SL) and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) data. We parametrically reconstruct the full three-dimensional structure (triaxial shape and principal axis orientation) of both the DM and the IC gas, and the level of non-thermal pressure of the IC gas. We find that the intermediate-major and minor-major axial ratios of the DM are 0.71 ± 0.08 and 0.59 ± 0.05, respectively, and that the major axis of the DM halo is inclined with respect to the line of sight at 18.3 ± 5.2 deg.

This has been evaluated to be a few per cent of the total energy budget in the internal regions, while it reaches approximately 20 per cent in the outer volumes.

We measure γ = 1.01 ± 0.06 and C = 4.32 ± 0.44; these values are close to the predictions of the CDM model. The combination of X-ray/SL data at high spatial resolution, which are capable of resolving the cluster core, with the SZ data, which are more sensitive to the cluster outer volume, allows us to characterize the level and the gradient of the gas entropy distribution and non-thermal pressure out to R<SUB>200</SUB>.

With the mass-density and velocity-anisotropy profiles we then obtain the first determination of a cluster pseudo-phase-space density profile. <BR /> Results: The kinematics and lensing determinations of the cluster mass profile are in excellent agreement.

The velocity anisotropy profiles of the passive and star-forming cluster members are similar, close to isotropic near the center and increasingly radial outside. Passive cluster members follow extremely well the theoretical expectations for the pseudo-phase-space density profile and the relation between the slope of the mass-density profile and the velocity anisotropy.

In the effort to understand and quantify inherent systematics in parametric strong lensing modelling, we explore a collection of 22 models in which we use different samples of multiple image families, different parametrizations of the mass distribution and cosmological parameters. <BR /> Methods: As input information for the strong lensing models, we use the Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH) imaging data and spectroscopic follow-up observations, with the VIsible Multi-Object Spectrograph (VIMOS) and Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) on the Very Large Telescope (VLT), to identify and characterize bona fide multiple image families and measure their redshifts down to m<SUB>F814W</SUB> ≃ 26. A total of 16 background sources, over the redshift range 1.0-6.1, are multiply lensed into 47 images, 24 of which are spectroscopically confirmed and belong to ten individual sources. These also include a multiply lensed Lyman-α blob at z = 3.118. The cluster total mass distribution and underlying cosmology in the models are optimized by matching the observed positions of the multiple images on the lens plane. Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques are used to quantify errors and covariances of the best-fit parameters. <BR /> Results: We show that with a careful selection of a large sample of spectroscopically confirmed multiple images, the best-fit model can reproduce their observed positions with a rms scatter of 0.̋3 in a fixed flat ΛCDM cosmology, whereas the lack of spectroscopic information or the use of inaccurate photometric redshifts can lead to biases in the values of the model parameters. We find that the best-fit parametrization for the cluster total mass distribution is composed of an elliptical pseudo-isothermal mass distribution with a significant core for the overall cluster halo and truncated pseudo-isothermal mass profiles for the cluster galaxies. We show that by adding bona fide photometric-selected multiple images to the sample of spectroscopic families, one can slightly improve constraints on the model parameters. In particular, we find that the degeneracy between the lens total mass distribution and the underlying geometry of the Universe, which is probed via angular diameter distance ratios between the lens and sources and the observer and sources, can be partially removed. Allowing cosmological parameters to vary together with the cluster parameters, we find (at 68% confidence level) Ω<SUB>m</SUB> = 0.25<SUP>+ 0.13</SUP><SUB>-0.16</SUB> and w = -1.07<SUP>+ 0.16</SUP><SUB>-0.42</SUB> for a flat ΛCDM model, and Ω<SUB>m</SUB> = 0.31<SUP>+ 0.12</SUP><SUB>-0.13</SUB> and Ω<SUB>Λ</SUB> = 0.38<SUP>+ 0.38</SUP><SUB>-0.27</SUB> for a Universe with w = -1 and free curvature. Finally, using toy models mimicking the overall configuration of multiple images and cluster total mass distribution, we estimate the impact of the line-of-sight mass structure on the positional rms to be 0.̋3 ± 0. We argue that the apparent sensitivity of our lensing model to cosmography is due to the combination of the regular potential shape of RXC J2248, a large number of bona fide multiple images out to z = 6.1, and a relatively modest presence of intervening large-scale structure, as revealed by our spectroscopic survey.','Caminha, G.

The total number of images comprised in these systems rises to 165, compared to 48 images in 16 systems before the HFF observations. Our analysis uses a parametric mass reconstruction technique, as implemented in the Lenstool software, and the subset of the 132 most secure multiple images to constrain a mass distribution composed of four large-scale mass components (spatially aligned with the four main light concentrations) and a multitude of galaxy-scale perturbers. We find a superposition of cored isothermal mass components to provide a good fit to the observational constraints, resulting in a very shallow mass distribution for the smooth (large-scale) component. Given the implications of such a flat mass profile, we investigate whether a model composed of "peaky" non-cored mass components can also reproduce the observational constraints. We find that such a non-cored mass model reproduces the observational constraints equally well, in the sense that both models give comparable total rms. Although the total (smooth dark matter component plus galaxy-scale perturbers) mass distributions of both models are consistent, as are the integrated two-dimensional mass profiles, we find that the smooth and the galaxy-scale components are very different. We conclude that, even in the HFF era, the generic degeneracy between smooth and galaxy-scale components is not broken, in particular in such a complex galaxy cluster. Consequently, insights into the mass distribution of MACS J0717 remain limited, emphasizing the need for additional probes beyond strong lensing. Our findings also have implications for estimates of the lensing magnification. We show that the amplification difference between the two models is larger than the error associated with either model, and that this additional systematic uncertainty is approximately the difference in magnification obtained by the different groups of modelers using pre-HFF data. This uncertainty decreases the area of the image plane where we can reliably study the high-redshift Universe by 50 to 70%.','Limousin, M., Richard, J., Jullo, E., Jauzac, M., Ebeling, H., Bonamigo, M., Alavi, A., Clément, B., Giocoli, C., Kneib, J. -P., Verdugo, T., Natarajan, P., Siana, B., Atek, H., Rexroth, M.','Strong-lensing analysis of MACS J0717.5+3745 from Hubble Frontier Fields observations: How well can the mass distribution be constrained?','Astronomy and Astrophysics','2016','A99','04','A99','https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016A&A...588A..99L','gravitational lensing: strong: galaxies: clusters: individual: MACS J0717.5+3745: Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics: Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies','','','','','','','article','','11',1,NOW(),'arXiv:1510.08077','5','10.1051/0004-6361/201527638' );

This paper presents the results obtained with the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) for the core of the lensing cluster Abell 1689, as part of MUSE's commissioning at the ESO Very Large Telescope. <BR /> Aims: Integral-field observations with MUSE provide a unique view of the central 1 × 1 arcmin<SUP>2</SUP> region at intermediate spectral resolution in the visible domain, allowing us to conduct a complete census of both cluster galaxies and lensed background sources. <BR /> Methods: We performed a spectroscopic analysis of all sources found in the MUSE data cube. Two hundred and eighty-two objects were systematically extracted from the cube based on a guided-and-manual approach. We also tested three different tools for the automated detection and extraction of line emitters. Cluster galaxies and lensed sources were identified based on their spectral features. We investigated the multiple-image configuration for all known sources in the field. <BR /> Results: Previous to our survey, 28 different lensed galaxies displaying 46 multiple images were known in the MUSE field of view, most of them were detected through photometric redshifts and lensing considerations. Of these, we spectroscopically confirm 12 images based on their emission lines, corresponding to 7 different lensed galaxies between z = 0.95 and 5.0. In addition, 14 new galaxies have been spectroscopically identified in this area thanks to MUSE data, with redshifts ranging between 0.8 and 6.2. All background sources detected within the MUSE field of view correspond to multiple-imaged systems lensed by A1689. Seventeen sources in total are found at z ≥ 3 based on their Lyman-α emission, with Lyman-α luminosities ranging between 40.5 ≲ log (Lyα) ≲ 42.5 after correction for magnification. This sample is particularly sensitive to the slope of the luminosity function toward the faintest end. The density of sources obtained in this survey is consistent with a steep value of α ≤ -1.5, although this result still needs further investigation. <BR /> Conclusions: These results illustrate the efficiency of MUSE in characterizing lensing clusters on one hand and in studying faint and distant populations of galaxies on the other hand.

We propose that the MACSJ0553 merger proceeds not in the plane of the sky, but at a large inclination angle, is observed very close to turnaround, and that the eastern X-ray peak is the cool core of the slightly less massive western component that was fully stripped and captured by the eastern subcluster during the collision. If correct, this hypothesis would make MACSJ0553 a superb target for a competitive study of ram-pressure stripping and the collisional behaviour of luminous and dark matter during cluster formation.','Ebeling, H., Qi, J., Richard, J.','Fully stripped?

Local gravitational lensing properties, such as convergence and shear, determined at the positions of multiply imaged background objects, yield valuable information on the smaller-scale lensing matter distribution in the central part of galaxy clusters. Highly distorted multiple images with resolved brightness features like the ones observed in CL0024 allow us to study these local lensing properties and to tighten the constraints on the properties of dark matter on sub-cluster scale. Aim. We investigate to what precision local magnification ratios, J, ratios of convergences, f, and reduced shears, g = (g<SUB>1</SUB>, g<SUB>2</SUB>), can be determined independently of a lens model for the five resolved multiple images of the source at z<SUB>s</SUB> = 1.675 in CL0024. We also determine if a comparison to the respective results obtained by the parametric modelling tool Lenstool and by the non-parametric modelling tool Grale can detect biases in the models. For these lens models, we analyse the influence of the number and location of the constraints from multiple images on the lens properties at the positions of the five multiple images of the source at z<SUB>s</SUB> = 1.675. <BR /> Methods: Our model-independent approach uses a linear mapping between the five resolved multiple images to determine the magnification ratios, ratios of convergences, and reduced shears at their positions. With constraints from up to six multiple image systems, we generate Lenstool and Grale models using the same image positions, cosmological parameters, and number of generated convergence and shear maps to determine the local values of J, f, and g at the same positions across all methods. <BR /> Results: All approaches show strong agreement on the local values of J, f, and g. We find that Lenstool obtains the tightest confidence bounds even for convergences around one using constraints from six multiple-image systems, while the best Grale model is generated only using constraints from all multiple images with resolved brightness features and adding limited small-scale mass corrections. Yet, confidence bounds as large as the values themselves can occur for convergences close to one in all approaches. <BR /> Conclusions: Our results agree with previous findings, support the light-traces-mass assumption, and the merger hypothesis for CL0024. Comparing the different approaches can detect model biases. The model-independent approach determines the local lens properties to a comparable precision in less than one second.','Wagner, Jenny, Liesenborgs, Jori, Tessore, Nicolas','Model-independent and model-based local lensing properties of CL0024+1654 from multiply imaged galaxies','Astronomy and Astrophysics','2018','A17','04','A17','https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A&A...612A..17W','dark matter: gravitational lensing: strong: methods: data analysis: methods: analytical: galaxies: clusters: individual: CL0024+1654: galaxies: luminosity function: mass function: Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics','','','','','','','article','','11',1,NOW(),'arXiv:1709.03531','6','10.1051/0004-6361/201731932' );

Different models were tested in each cluster depending on the complexity of its mass distribution and on the number of detected multiple images. Four clusters show more than five spectroscopically confirmed multiple image families. In this sample, we did not make use of families that are only photometrically identified in order to reduce model degeneracies between the values of the total mass of a cluster source redshifts, in addition to systematics due to the potential misidentifications of multiple images. For the remaining four clusters, we used additional families without any spectroscopic confirmation to increase the number of strong lensing constraints up to the number of free parameters in our parametric models.

These values are consistent with a rising LAE fraction with redshift out to z ∼ 6, but at z ∼ 6.5, there is some tension between our results and results from surveys at intrinsically brighter luminosities. We conclude that intrinsically fainter galaxies have Lyα emission, and there is a steep drop in the LAE fraction from our high-redshift sample at z ∼ 6.5 and from similar galaxies at z ∼ 7.5. This likely indicates we are witnessing the tail end of the epoch of reionization, as such a drop is not expected due to changes of intrinsic galaxy properties between these redshifts.','Fuller, S., Lemaux, B.

In the meantime, there is only a very small set of lensed galaxies where such spatial detail is possible at wavelengths containing important rest-optical emission lines, even with the Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field Camera 3 infrared channel grisms. Here, we examine two of these sources, SDSS J1723+3411 and SDSS J2340+2947, using HST WFC3/IR grism data and supporting spatially unresolved spectroscopy from several ground-based instruments to explore the size of spatial variations in observed strong emission-line ratios like O32 and R23, which are sensitive to ionization parameter and metallicity, and the Balmer decrement, which is an indicator of reddening. We find significant spatial variation in the reddening and in the reddening-corrected O32 and R23 values that correspond to spreads of a few tenths of a dex in ionization parameter and metallicity. We also find clear evidence of a negative radial gradient in star formation in SDSS J2340+2947 and tentative evidence of one in SDSS J1723+3411, though its star formation is quite asymmetric.

Together these two models probe different possible solutions in a relatively self-consistent manner and can be used to examine systematic uncertainties and relevant differences between the two parameterizations. We obtain reasonably similar (agreeing to within ≃1σ-3σ, in most cases) time delays and magnification ratios, with respect to S1, from the two different methods, although the LTM predictions seem to be systematically shorter/smaller for some of the images. Most notably, the time delay [and 95% CI] between the Einstein cross (in particular, image S1), and SX, differs substantially between the parametric method (326 [300-359] days) and the LTM method (224 [198-306] days), which seems to underestimate the true reappearance time. The cause for this systematic difference is unclear at present.

The observed spatial variations indicate the presence of a steep velocity gradient in a continuous flow of high column density gas from star-forming regions into a low-density halo environment. A detailed inspection of available galaxy spectra shows no evidence of AGN activity in the galaxies, and the observed Ly α signals are primarily explained by resonant scattering.

We use deep residual neural networks, building on previous work presented by Huang et al. These surveys together cover approximately one-third of the sky visible from the Northern Hemisphere, reaching a z-band AB magnitude of \u223c22.5. We compile a training sample that consists of known lensing systems as well as non-lenses in the Legacy Surveys and the Dark Energy Survey. After applying our trained neural networks to the survey data, we visually inspect and rank images with probabilities above a threshold. Here we present 1210 new strong lens candidates.", "doi": "10.3847/1538-4357/abd62b", "custom1": "eprint: arXiv:2005.04730", "issn": "0004-637X", "number": "1"}, "ADS link": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...909...27H", "Publisher link via ADS gateway": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/link_gateway/2021ApJ...909...27H/PUB_HTML", "Action": "Aborted since: Blocked.

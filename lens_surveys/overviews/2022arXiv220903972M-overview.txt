The lensed quasar images were identified in a search for lens systems in recent public optical imaging data and have separations on the sky up to 25\".9, wider than any previously known lensed quasar. The galaxy cluster acting as a strong lens appears to be in the process of merging, with two sub-clusters separated by $\\sim 1$ Mpc in the plane of the sky, and their central galaxies showing a radial velocity difference of $\\sim 1000$ km/s. Both cluster cores show strongly lensed images of an assortment of background sources, as does the region between them. A preliminary strong lens model implies masses of $M(<250\\ \\rm{kpc}) = 1.79^{+0.16} _{-0.01} \\times 10^{14} M_{\\odot}$ and $M(<250\\ \\rm{kpc}) = 1.48^{+0.04}_{-0.10} \\times 10^{14} M_{\\odot}$ for the East and West sub-clusters, respectively. This line of sight is also coincident with a ROSAT ALL-sky Survey source, centered between the two confirmed cluster halos reminiscent of other major cluster-scale mergers.", "custom1": "eprint: arXiv:2209.03972"}, "ADS link": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv220903972M", "Publisher link via ADS gateway": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/link_gateway/2022arXiv220903972M/EPRINT_HTML", "Action": "Did not process since arXiv."}

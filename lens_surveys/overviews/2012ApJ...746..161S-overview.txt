The relevant data are typically limited by the surface brightness of these galaxies, and their spatial size only allows a measurement of the galaxy as a whole, limiting our ability to understand where in the galaxy processes like star formation occur. To reach sufficient levels of signal to noise, studies often stack spectra of many galaxies, thus averaging over a population (e.g., Shapley et al. <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"apj417477r15\">2003</xref>; Reddy et al. <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"apj417477r13\">2010</xref>). The only means to study individual high-<italic>z</italic> galaxies in detail, at least until the era of <italic>James Webb Space Telescope</italic> and 30 m class telescopes, is to analyze lensed galaxies whose brightnesses are magnified, and spatial sizes are stretched by the gravitational potential of the lens, making them suitable for spatially resolved spectroscopy. Such a rare case of a lensed galaxy was recently discovered in the second Red Sequence Cluster Survey (RCS2; Gilbank et al. <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"apj417477r4\">2011</xref>) Giant Arc Survey (M. B. Bayliss et al., in preparation), as an extremely bright, highly stretched lensed galaxy at <italic>z</italic> &equals; 1.7, lensed by the cluster RCS2 032727-132623. The giant arc, labeled RCSGA 032727-132609, is &sim;38&Prime; long and has a moderately magnified counter image. In Wuyts et al. (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"apj417477r17\">2010</xref>), we report the discovery of RCSGA 032727-132609, spectral confirmation, the measurement and modeling of its spectral energy distribution (SED) from ground-based data, and a preliminary strong-lensing mass model of the lensing cluster. In Rigby et al. (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"apj417477r14\">2011</xref>; hereafter R11), we analyze a Keck&sol;NIRSPEC spectrum of the brightest part of the arc to determine the physical conditions in this galaxy. The interpretation of our findings in both papers relied on a preliminary lens model based on ground-based imaging, which did not allow unique identification of arc substructure at the level required for a robust lens model; this limited our ability to fully understand the lensed, highly distorted arc in terms of its source morphology. It also compromises the precision and accuracy with which we can determine the average magnification of the galaxy, a property crucial for calculating intrinsic properties such as the star formation rate. In this paper, we use <italic>Hubble Space Telescope</italic> (<italic>HST</italic>) imaging with Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) to uniquely identify features in the lensed galaxy. With the dramatic improvement in spatial resolution (less than 0&farcs;1 FWHM in the UVIS channel) relative to the ground-based data (0&farcs;5 seeing at best, see Wuyts et al. <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"apj417477r17\">2010</xref>), these data, along with newly discovered additional multiply lensed galaxies, are used to generate a robust lens model of the cluster. The observations and data reduction are described in Section <xref ref-type=\"sec\" rid=\"apj417477s2\">2</xref>. Lensing analysis and derived magnifications are presented in Sections <xref ref-type=\"sec\" rid=\"apj417477s3\">3</xref> and <xref ref-type=\"sec\" rid=\"apj417477s4\">4</xref>; and in Section <xref ref-type=\"sec\" rid=\"apj417477s5\">5</xref>, the physical conditions of the source are revisited, based on the new lens model. We assume a flat cosmology with &Omega;<sub>&Lambda;</sub> &equals; 0.7, &Omega;<sub><italic>m</italic></sub> &equals; 0.3, and <italic>H</italic><sub>0</sub> &equals; 70&nbsp;km&nbsp;s<sup>&minus;1</sup> Mpc<sup>&minus;1</sup>. Magnitudes are reported in the AB system.</p></sec>\n<sec id=\"apj417477s2\"><label>2.</label><title>OBSERVATIONS</title>\n<p>The field of RCS2 032727-132623<?floatout type=\"fig\" id=\"apj417477f1\"?> was imaged by <italic>HST</italic>&sol;WFC3 on 2011 March 1 UT, during four orbits, as part of GO program 12267 (PI: Rigby). The data were acquired using six broadband filters and one narrowband filter: F390W (total exposure time 1401&nbsp;s), F606W (1003&nbsp;s), and F814W (2133&nbsp;s) in the UVIS channel, and F098M (1212&nbsp;s), F125W (862&nbsp;s), F132N (2212&nbsp;s), and F160W (862&nbsp;s) in the IR channel. The IR medium&sol;wide filters were chosen in order to measure the Balmer break, and to subtract the continuum light from the narrowband IR filter, F132N, which samples the H&beta; line at 1.3153&thinsp;&mu;m. The UVIS imaging samples the spatially resolved UV spectral slope.</p>\n<p>The imaging strategy consists of four sub-pixel dither positions in each filter to reconstruct the point-spread function (PSF), reject cosmic rays, and compensate for chip gap. The IR-channel exposures were obtained in the SPARS50 readout sequence mode. Individual frames were processed with the standard WFC3 calibration pipeline, and combined using the Multidrizzle routine (Koekemoer et al. <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"apj417477r7\">2002</xref>) to remove cosmic-ray hits and dead or hot pixels, with a square kernel, <monospace>pixfrac&equals;1.0</monospace> and <monospace>scale&equals;INDEF</monospace>.</p>\n<p>Since the pixel scale and the PSF vary between filters, a set of PSF-matched images was created by convolving each image with a Gaussian kernel to approximate the PSF of the F160W image, which has the broadest PSF. These images were used for measurements of magnitudes and colors. For the purpose of detection and identification of multiple images, the unconvolved, best-resolution images were used and are shown here.</p></sec>\n<sec id=\"apj417477s3\"><label>3.</label><title>STRONG-LENSING MASS MODEL</title>\n<sec id=\"apj417477s3-1\"><label>3.1.</label><title>Identification of Multiply Imaged Galaxies</title>\n<sec id=\"apj417477s3-1-1\"><label>3.1.1.</label><title>RCSGA 032727-132609</title>\n<p>The source galaxy of RCSGA 032727-132609 is lensed into five images, as labeled in Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"apj417477f1\">1</xref>: three of them are merged, forming the giant arc; a fourth image appears as the &ldquo;counter image&rdquo; 31&farcs;5 south of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG); a fifth, demagnified, image is predicted by the lens model, and a careful inspection of the <italic>HST</italic> imaging reveals its presence 0&farcs;6 north of the BCG, partially embedded in the BCG light. The ground-based data that were used in Wuyts et al. (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"apj417477r17\">2010</xref>) already indicate the existence of substructure in the source galaxy and subsequently its lensed images. However, since those data lack the needed resolution, we were unable to uniquely match features in the different instances of the lensed galaxy with each other. Moreover, substructure in the &ldquo;counter image&rdquo; is not resolved in those data. The new <italic>HST</italic> data, combined with an initial lens model, make the interpretation of the morphology unambiguous. Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"apj417477f1\">1</xref> labels the different emission knots in each instance of the multiply lensed galaxy. Note that not all the parts of the source galaxy are represented in all of its lensed instances (see Section <xref ref-type=\"sec\" rid=\"apj417477s3-3\">3.3</xref>). The coordinates of each emission knot were used as constraints in computing the lens model.</p>\n<fig id=\"apj417477f1\" position=\"float\">\n<label>Figure 1.</label>\n<caption><p>Identification of substructure in the five images of the multiply lensed source RCSGA 032727-132609. The color rendition is composed of F160W, F125W, F098M (red); F814W, F606W (green); and F390W (blue), to highlight color gradients in the arc. The dashed lines approximately enclose the parts of the arc that compose each image, indicated by numbers. The labels used in Wuyts et al. (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"apj417477r17\">2010</xref>) are also indicated for clarity. We include another color rendition for image 5, composed of the UVIS bands only (F814W, F606W, F390W) and different scaling, to better separate image 5 from the BCG. The emission knots in images 1&ndash;4 are labeled with letters a through k. The BCG is labeled in the renditions of image 5, as are the two cluster galaxies (G1, G2) that interrupt image 3. Note that the a&ndash;f knots (red labels) appear in all of the images (although hard to identify in image 5), while the brightest knot of the source (labeled g) and the &ldquo;blue&rdquo; arm (h&ndash;k; blue labels) only appear in images 3, 4, and 5 (see the text for an explanation). In image 3, the lensing perturbation by a cluster galaxy results in another instance of some parts of the source, likely the emission knot labeled g. We note that knots c, d, and f in images 3 and 4 were not used as constraints in the lens modeling, since their positions are not as well determined as in the other images. The very red extension at the end of the &ldquo;red&rdquo; arm (labeled r, s, t), and the highly magnified region labeled u, were also not set as positional constraints in the model, but were used to evaluate models by demanding an agreement between model-predicted source morphologies derived from the different images.</p></caption><graphic id=\"apj417477f1_eps\" content-type=\"print\" alt-version=\"yes\" xlink:href=\"apj417477f1_pr.eps\"/>\n<graphic id=\"apj417477f1_tb\" content-type=\"thumb\" alt-version=\"yes\" xlink:href=\"apj417477f1_tb.jpg\"/>\n<graphic id=\"apj417477f1_lr\" content-type=\"low\" alt-version=\"yes\" xlink:href=\"apj417477f1_lr.jpg\"/>\n<graphic id=\"apj417477f1_hr\" content-type=\"high\" alt-version=\"yes\" xlink:href=\"apj417477f1_hr.jpg\"/>\n<graphic id=\"apj417477f1_au\" content-type=\"author\" xlink:href=\"apj417477f1_au.ps\"/></fig></sec>\n<sec id=\"apj417477s3-1-2\"><label>3.1.2.</label><title>Other Background Sources</title>\n<p>Apart from the extraordinary giant arc, several other background galaxies appear to be lensed into arcs and are labeled in Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"apj417477f2\">2</xref>.

Cluster galaxies were selected by their <italic>V</italic>&minus;<italic>I</italic> color with respect to the cluster red sequence in a color&ndash;magnitude diagram. We impose a magnitude cutoff and include only galaxies brighter than 24 mag in the <italic>i</italic>-band within 54&Prime; from the cluster center. This conservative selection guarantees that we take into account any red-sequence galaxy whose lensing contribution is large enough to deflect the lensed images by an amount comparable to the measurement error (see, e.g., Jullo et al. <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"apj417477r6\">2007</xref>; Limousin et al. <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"apj417477r8\">2010</xref>).

Two cluster galaxies (labeled G1 and G2 in Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"apj417477f1\">1</xref>) are superimposed on the western portion of the giant arc (see also Wuyts et al. <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"apj417477r17\">2010</xref>). We include these galaxies individually, with <italic>x</italic>, <italic>y</italic>, <italic>e</italic>, and position angle fixed at the observed values. Although perturbation from cluster galaxies is an essential component in the model, the proximity of the observed arcs to cluster galaxies is not small enough to constrain their model parameters, meaning that a large region in the galaxy parameter space is allowed by the constraints. We therefore report the best-fit value and the range that was set as prior instead of a formal uncertainty.</p>\n<p>The best-fit model is found in an iterative manner.

An initial lens model predicted a counter image &sim;30&Prime; north of the BCG (S7c), which is detected in the data with excellent morphological resemblance to the model-predicted image. We thus include the three images of S7 (S7a and S7b, which form a merging-pair radial arc, and S7c) as additional constraints. We set a prior on the redshift of this source to be larger than 1.7, as its critical curve, which is tightly constrained by the two arcs that form the radial arc, indicates that it is at a higher redshift than the primary giant arc. The modeling process predicts a redshift of 2.29<sup>&plus;0.08</sup><sub>&minus; 0.05</sub> for this source. By including the three images of S7 in the model we are able to significantly reduce the uncertainty in model parameters, and consequently in the magnifications, from &sim;50&percnt; to &sim;10&percnt;. Detailed simulations, in which we model the cluster assuming that the redshift of S7 is known, indicate that securing a spectroscopic redshift for S7 would further reduce the magnification uncertainty to the few-percent level. This agrees with the results of Jullo et al. (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"apj417477r6\">2007</xref>), who tested simulated lens potential parameter degeneracies, and with Miralda-Escude (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"apj417477r12\">1995</xref>), who showed that radial arcs and their counter images provide a stringent constraint on the profile shape as well as the enclosed mass. Thus, while S7 already improves the magnification uncertainties by a factor of five (relative to a model constrained only by the primary giant arc and the counter image), measuring a redshift for it is an obvious high priority, since it would further improve the model uncertainties to &lt;10&percnt;.</p>\n<p>In total, we have 44 constraints and 19 free parameters, resulting in an overconstrained model. In the future, one might be able to include additional substructure in the cluster mass distribution to make the ultimate lens model. For now, we choose to not include substructure whose existence is not directly motivated by an observed counterpart.</p></sec>\n<sec id=\"apj417477s3-3\"><label>3.3.</label><title>Source Reconstruction</title>\n<p>The source-plane reconstruction is done by ray-tracing the pixels in the observed frame through the lensing potential of the best-fit lens model (see Figures <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"apj417477f2\">2</xref> and <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"apj417477f3\">3</xref>). In the process, we preserve the spatial information by allowing de-lensed pixels to have arbitrary shapes and sizes. The source reconstruction is used as a tool to understand the mapping between the distorted images of the multiply lensed source and the source itself. The location of the source galaxy with respect to the source-plane caustics determines the geometry, multiplicity, and parity of each of its lensed images. As in many cases of giant arcs, the source galaxy is positioned such that a caustic crosses it, resulting in a high magnification. In the case of RCSGA 032727-132609, as can be seen in Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"apj417477f2\">2</xref>, the caustic that corresponds to the NE tangential critical curve separates the source into two general parts. The part that lies inside the caustic is multiply imaged five times: its instances are images 1, 2, and part of images 3, 4, and 5. The part of the source that remains outside the caustic is multiply imaged only three times, in images 3, 4, and 5, and &ldquo;vanishes&rdquo; in the merging-pair images 1 and 2. The bright region that extends to both sides of the critical curve between images 1 and 2 is in fact mapped to an extremely small area in the source, directly inward to the caustic. This source-plane to image-plane mapping may be best understood from Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"apj417477f3\">3</xref>, which shows four separate reconstructions of the source, each one from a different lensed image. In Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"apj417477f4\">4</xref> (and the inset in Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"apj417477f1\">1</xref>), we merge these four reconstructions by combining the best-resolved segments of the source into one frame. Note that a faint area at the &ldquo;left&rdquo; edge of the source, which crosses back into the critical curve (designated by label A in Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"apj417477f4\">4</xref>), is also highly magnified to form the faint tangential arc labeled as A in Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"apj417477f2\">2</xref>.</p>\n<fig id=\"apj417477f3\" position=\"float\" fig-type=\"color\">\n<label>Figure 3.</label>\n<caption><p>Source reconstruction from each of the magnified images of RCSGA 032727-132609.

This new measurement is now consistent with the SFRs inferred from the broadband SED and from the mid-IR.</p></sec>\n<sec id=\"apj417477s6\"><label>6.</label><title>SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS</title>\n<p>We use new <italic>HST</italic>&sol;WFC3 imaging data to construct a robust lens model for the lensing cluster RCS2 032727-132623. Using the new lens model, we map out the magnification of the highly magnified arc RCSGA 032727-132609 and construct a de-lensed image of the source galaxy. Due to the location of the galaxy in the source plane with respect to the lensing caustics, parts of the source are multiply imaged five times, while other parts are multiply imaged only three times in a merging-pair configuration. In particular, we find that the brightest parts of the giant arc, which were targeted for rest-frame optical spectroscopy by R11, are lensed images of a small region of the source galaxy (&sim;10&percnt; of the spatial size of the galaxy).</p>\n<p>The resolution of the <italic>HST</italic> data allows us to uniquely identify features in the different lensed images of the source and identify additional lensed galaxies. The resultant lens model is superior to the previously published lens model (Wuyts et al. <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"apj417477r17\">2010</xref>) based on ground-based data. To quantify this claim, we compare the magnification uncertainty between models, a value that is crucial for understanding the physical conditions in the source galaxy through a measurement of the intrinsic, unlensed, luminosity (see Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"apj417477f8\">8</xref>). Since the ground-based lens model was not robust enough to measure the magnification of the giant arc directly, we concentrate on the easier to measure, less sensitive magnification of its counter image. In the top panel, we plot a histogram of the magnifications that were derived from a suit of simulated lens models, with parameters drawn from MCMC steps in this work. The same is shown in the bottom panel, for the model published in Wuyts et al. (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"apj417477r17\">2010</xref>). The magnifications in each set are divided by the magnifications from the best-fit models to enable the comparison. We find that even in the case of the counter image, the magnification uncertainty improves by a factor of four when using high-resolution <italic>HST</italic> data. We emphasize that the model presented in Wuyts et al. (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"apj417477r17\">2010</xref>) is based on wrong assumptions about the mapping of the counter images to each other; in particular, the brightest emission knot marked g in Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"apj417477f1\">1</xref> was assumed to have a counter image in images 1 (Aa) and 2 (Ab) of the giant arc, whereas we now understand that this is not the case. Thus, the magnification that was derived from it was not accurate, and the uncertainty was probably underestimated.</p>\n<fig id=\"apj417477f8\" position=\"float\">\n<label>Figure 8.</label>\n<caption><p>Comparison of the magnification uncertainty between a lens model based on <italic>HST</italic> data (this work) and a lens model based on ground-based data (Wuyts et al. <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"apj417477r17\">2010</xref>). In each panel, we plot the <italic>counter-image</italic> magnifications, derived from a suit of simulated lens models (see Section <xref ref-type=\"sec\" rid=\"apj417477s4\">4</xref>), and divided by the magnification from the best-fit model. The top panel shows the <italic>HST</italic>-based magnification histogram, and the bottom panel shows the ground-based magnification histogram. The width of each histogram represents the uncertainty in the magnification of the counter image. We find that the magnification uncertainty becomes four times smaller in the model based on <italic>HST</italic> data, even in the case of the counter image, whose magnification is less sensitive to the details of the model due to its distance from the critical curve.</p></caption><graphic id=\"apj417477f8_eps\" content-type=\"print\" alt-version=\"yes\" xlink:href=\"apj417477f8_pr.eps\"/>\n<graphic id=\"apj417477f8_tb\" content-type=\"thumb\" alt-version=\"yes\" xlink:href=\"apj417477f8_tb.jpg\"/>\n<graphic id=\"apj417477f8_lr\" content-type=\"low\" alt-version=\"yes\" xlink:href=\"apj417477f8_lr.jpg\"/>\n<graphic id=\"apj417477f8_hr\" content-type=\"high\" alt-version=\"yes\" xlink:href=\"apj417477f8_hr.jpg\"/>\n<graphic id=\"apj417477f8_au\" content-type=\"author\" xlink:href=\"apj417477f8_au.ps\"/></fig>\n<p>We use the new model to estimate the average magnification within the R11 NIRSPEC aperture, 42.2 &plusmn; 5.5. Based on this magnification, we find that the average SFR within the aperture is 29 &plusmn; 8, significantly lower than the value we reported in R11, a value that was estimated under the assumption that the source is uniform and the sampled region is representative of the entire source. We remind the reader that this knowingly wrong assumption was the only possible assumption at the time, with only a preliminary mass model in hand. In R11, the SFR was estimated by multiplying the flux by the luminosity-weighted fraction of the galaxy that is covered by the slit, and dividing by the average magnification of the giant arc. This procedure results in an effective magnification which is several times too small and implies an extremely high SFR for the entire source. In practice, the region sampled by the slit, as illustrated in Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"apj417477f6\">6</xref>, represents only about 10&percnt; of the physical size of the source; it does not cover the brightest part of the source and is probably not representative of the entire galaxy, as we suspected in R11. The higher value of this updated magnification reinforces the usefulness of RCSGA 032727-132609 for probing down the luminosity function at high redshift, particularly with ALMA.</p>\n<p>The results shown in this paper allow the precise mapping of the knots in the arc to the source plane for the first time. This work enables many other investigations. In an upcoming paper, we will analyze spectra on a knot-by-knot basis to study the degree to which physical conditions vary across the arc. We also intend to use the high-resolution <italic>HST</italic> imaging presented in this paper to map on a pixel-by-pixel basis the SED, SFR, and extinction of the source, which we defer to a future paper. Further spectroscopy should provide secure redshifts for one or more of the secondary arcs, which will reduce the uncertainty in model parameters and the magnification to the few-percent level, making RCSGA 032727-132609 one of the best understood lensed high-<italic>z</italic> galaxies.</p></sec></body>\n<back>\n<ack><p>Support for program 12267 was provided by NASA through a grant from the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.

The relevant data are typically limited by the surface brightness of these galaxies, and their spatial size only allows a measurement of the galaxy as a whole, limiting our ability to understand where in the galaxy processes like star formation occur. To reach sufficient levels of signal to noise, studies often stack spectra of many galaxies, thus averaging over a population (e.g., Shapley et al. <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"apj417477r15\">2003</xref>; Reddy et al. <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"apj417477r13\">2010</xref>). The only means to study individual high-<italic>z</italic> galaxies in detail, at least until the era of <italic>James Webb Space Telescope</italic> and 30 m class telescopes, is to analyze lensed galaxies whose brightnesses are magnified, and spatial sizes are stretched by the gravitational potential of the lens, making them suitable for spatially resolved spectroscopy. Such a rare case of a lensed galaxy was recently discovered in the second Red Sequence Cluster Survey (RCS2; Gilbank et al. <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"apj417477r4\">2011</xref>) Giant Arc Survey (M. B. Bayliss et al., in preparation), as an extremely bright, highly stretched lensed galaxy at <italic>z</italic> &equals; 1.7, lensed by the cluster RCS2 032727-132623. The giant arc, labeled RCSGA 032727-132609, is &sim;38&Prime; long and has a moderately magnified counter image. In Wuyts et al. (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"apj417477r17\">2010</xref>), we report the discovery of RCSGA 032727-132609, spectral confirmation, the measurement and modeling of its spectral energy distribution (SED) from ground-based data, and a preliminary strong-lensing mass model of the lensing cluster. In Rigby et al. (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"apj417477r14\">2011</xref>; hereafter R11), we analyze a Keck&sol;NIRSPEC spectrum of the brightest part of the arc to determine the physical conditions in this galaxy. The interpretation of our findings in both papers relied on a preliminary lens model based on ground-based imaging, which did not allow unique identification of arc substructure at the level required for a robust lens model; this limited our ability to fully understand the lensed, highly distorted arc in terms of its source morphology. It also compromises the precision and accuracy with which we can determine the average magnification of the galaxy, a property crucial for calculating intrinsic properties such as the star formation rate. In this paper, we use <italic>Hubble Space Telescope</italic> (<italic>HST</italic>) imaging with Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) to uniquely identify features in the lensed galaxy. With the dramatic improvement in spatial resolution (less than 0&farcs;1 FWHM in the UVIS channel) relative to the ground-based data (0&farcs;5 seeing at best, see Wuyts et al. <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"apj417477r17\">2010</xref>), these data, along with newly discovered additional multiply lensed galaxies, are used to generate a robust lens model of the cluster. The observations and data reduction are described in Section <xref ref-type=\"sec\" rid=\"apj417477s2\">2</xref>. Lensing analysis and derived magnifications are presented in Sections <xref ref-type=\"sec\" rid=\"apj417477s3\">3</xref> and <xref ref-type=\"sec\" rid=\"apj417477s4\">4</xref>; and in Section <xref ref-type=\"sec\" rid=\"apj417477s5\">5</xref>, the physical conditions of the source are revisited, based on the new lens model. We assume a flat cosmology with &Omega;<sub>&Lambda;</sub> &equals; 0.7, &Omega;<sub><italic>m</italic></sub> &equals; 0.3, and <italic>H</italic><sub>0</sub> &equals; 70&nbsp;km&nbsp;s<sup>&minus;1</sup> Mpc<sup>&minus;1</sup>.

The data were acquired using six broadband filters and one narrowband filter: F390W (total exposure time 1401&nbsp;s), F606W (1003&nbsp;s), and F814W (2133&nbsp;s) in the UVIS channel, and F098M (1212&nbsp;s), F125W (862&nbsp;s), F132N (2212&nbsp;s), and F160W (862&nbsp;s) in the IR channel. The IR medium&sol;wide filters were chosen in order to measure the Balmer break, and to subtract the continuum light from the narrowband IR filter, F132N, which samples the H&beta; line at 1.3153&thinsp;&mu;m. The UVIS imaging samples the spatially resolved UV spectral slope.</p>\n<p>The imaging strategy consists of four sub-pixel dither positions in each filter to reconstruct the point-spread function (PSF), reject cosmic rays, and compensate for chip gap. The IR-channel exposures were obtained in the SPARS50 readout sequence mode. Individual frames were processed with the standard WFC3 calibration pipeline, and combined using the Multidrizzle routine (Koekemoer et al. <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"apj417477r7\">2002</xref>) to remove cosmic-ray hits and dead or hot pixels, with a square kernel, <monospace>pixfrac&equals;1.0</monospace> and <monospace>scale&equals;INDEF</monospace>.</p>\n<p>Since the pixel scale and the PSF vary between filters, a set of PSF-matched images was created by convolving each image with a Gaussian kernel to approximate the PSF of the F160W image, which has the broadest PSF. These images were used for measurements of magnitudes and colors. For the purpose of detection and identification of multiple images, the unconvolved, best-resolution images were used and are shown here.</p></sec>\n<sec id=\"apj417477s3\"><label>3.</label><title>STRONG-LENSING MASS MODEL</title>\n<sec id=\"apj417477s3-1\"><label>3.1.</label><title>Identification of Multiply Imaged Galaxies</title>\n<sec id=\"apj417477s3-1-1\"><label>3.1.1.</label><title>RCSGA 032727-132609</title>\n<p>The source galaxy of RCSGA 032727-132609 is lensed into five images, as labeled in Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"apj417477f1\">1</xref>: three of them are merged, forming the giant arc; a fourth image appears as the &ldquo;counter image&rdquo; 31&farcs;5 south of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG); a fifth, demagnified, image is predicted by the lens model, and a careful inspection of the <italic>HST</italic> imaging reveals its presence 0&farcs;6 north of the BCG, partially embedded in the BCG light. The ground-based data that were used in Wuyts et al. (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"apj417477r17\">2010</xref>) already indicate the existence of substructure in the source galaxy and subsequently its lensed images. However, since those data lack the needed resolution, we were unable to uniquely match features in the different instances of the lensed galaxy with each other. Moreover, substructure in the &ldquo;counter image&rdquo; is not resolved in those data. The new <italic>HST</italic> data, combined with an initial lens model, make the interpretation of the morphology unambiguous. Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"apj417477f1\">1</xref> labels the different emission knots in each instance of the multiply lensed galaxy. Note that not all the parts of the source galaxy are represented in all of its lensed instances (see Section <xref ref-type=\"sec\" rid=\"apj417477s3-3\">3.3</xref>).

We include another color rendition for image 5, composed of the UVIS bands only (F814W, F606W, F390W) and different scaling, to better separate image 5 from the BCG. The emission knots in images 1&ndash;4 are labeled with letters a through k. The BCG is labeled in the renditions of image 5, as are the two cluster galaxies (G1, G2) that interrupt image 3. Note that the a&ndash;f knots (red labels) appear in all of the images (although hard to identify in image 5), while the brightest knot of the source (labeled g) and the &ldquo;blue&rdquo; arm (h&ndash;k; blue labels) only appear in images 3, 4, and 5 (see the text for an explanation). In image 3, the lensing perturbation by a cluster galaxy results in another instance of some parts of the source, likely the emission knot labeled g. We note that knots c, d, and f in images 3 and 4 were not used as constraints in the lens modeling, since their positions are not as well determined as in the other images. The very red extension at the end of the &ldquo;red&rdquo; arm (labeled r, s, t), and the highly magnified region labeled u, were also not set as positional constraints in the model, but were used to evaluate models by demanding an agreement between model-predicted source morphologies derived from the different images.</p></caption><graphic id=\"apj417477f1_eps\" content-type=\"print\" alt-version=\"yes\" xlink:href=\"apj417477f1_pr.eps\"/>\n<graphic id=\"apj417477f1_tb\" content-type=\"thumb\" alt-version=\"yes\" xlink:href=\"apj417477f1_tb.jpg\"/>\n<graphic id=\"apj417477f1_lr\" content-type=\"low\" alt-version=\"yes\" xlink:href=\"apj417477f1_lr.jpg\"/>\n<graphic id=\"apj417477f1_hr\" content-type=\"high\" alt-version=\"yes\" xlink:href=\"apj417477f1_hr.jpg\"/>\n<graphic id=\"apj417477f1_au\" content-type=\"author\" xlink:href=\"apj417477f1_au.ps\"/></fig></sec>\n<sec id=\"apj417477s3-1-2\"><label>3.1.2.</label><title>Other Background Sources</title>\n<p>Apart from the extraordinary giant arc, several other background galaxies appear to be lensed into arcs and are labeled in Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"apj417477f2\">2</xref>.

Since the identification of all the multiply lensed images of S7 is robust, we include this arc as a constraint in our lens modeling below, setting its redshift as a free parameter, allowing for it to be solved in the modeling process.

The cluster is represented by a pseudo-isothermal ellipsoid mass distribution (PIEMD; Limousin et al. <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"apj417477r9\">2005</xref>),<xref ref-type=\"fn\" rid=\"apj417477fn2\"><sup>6</sup></xref><fn id=\"apj417477fn2\"><label>6</label><p>This profile is formally the same as dual Pseudo Isothermal Elliptical Mass Distribution (dPIE; see El&iacute;asd&oacute;ttir et al. <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"apj417477r3\">2007</xref>).</p></fn> parameterized by its position <italic>x</italic>, <italic>y</italic>; a fiducial velocity dispersion &sigma;; a core radius <italic>r</italic><sub>core</sub>; a scale radius <italic>r<sub>s</sub></italic>; ellipticity <italic>e</italic> &equals; (<italic>a</italic><sup>2</sup> &minus; <italic>b</italic><sup>2</sup>)&sol;(<italic>a</italic><sup>2</sup> &plus; <italic>b</italic><sup>2</sup>), where <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic> are the semimajor and semiminor axes, respectively; and a position angle &theta;. All the parameters of the mass distribution are allowed to vary within priors. We set a Gaussian prior on &sigma; based on the observed velocity dispersion of the cluster (Wuyts et al. <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"apj417477r17\">2010</xref>). Solving the equations in El&iacute;asd&oacute;ttir et al. (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"apj417477r3\">2007</xref>, Appendix A) for typical cluster values of <italic>r</italic><sub>core</sub> and <italic>r<sub>s</sub></italic>, and the radius in which the velocity dispersion was measured, we find that a small scaling of &sim;1&percnt; is needed in order to convert the observed velocity dispersion to the PIEMD &sigma; parameter. Cluster galaxies were selected by their <italic>V</italic>&minus;<italic>I</italic> color with respect to the cluster red sequence in a color&ndash;magnitude diagram. We impose a magnitude cutoff and include only galaxies brighter than 24 mag in the <italic>i</italic>-band within 54&Prime; from the cluster center. This conservative selection guarantees that we take into account any red-sequence galaxy whose lensing contribution is large enough to deflect the lensed images by an amount comparable to the measurement error (see, e.g., Jullo et al. <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"apj417477r6\">2007</xref>; Limousin et al. <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"apj417477r8\">2010</xref>). Each galaxy is represented by a PIEMD, with parameters that follow the observed properties of the galaxies through scaling relations (see Limousin et al. <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"apj417477r10\">2007</xref> for description of the scaling relations). The free parameters, representative of an <italic>L</italic>&ast; elliptical galaxy, are &sigma;&ast;, which is allowed to vary in the range [50, 150] km&nbsp;s<sup>&minus;1</sup>, and <italic>r</italic>&ast;<sub>cut</sub>, which is forced to be smaller than 70&nbsp;kpc, following Limousin et al. (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"apj417477r11\">2008</xref>).</p>\n<p>The BCG is represented by a PIEMD, with <italic>x</italic>, <italic>y</italic>, <italic>e</italic>, and position angle fixed at the observed values, and <italic>r</italic><sub>cut</sub> fixed at 40&nbsp;kpc. Two cluster galaxies (labeled G1 and G2 in Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"apj417477f1\">1</xref>) are superimposed on the western portion of the giant arc (see also Wuyts et al. <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"apj417477r17\">2010</xref>). We include these galaxies individually, with <italic>x</italic>, <italic>y</italic>, <italic>e</italic>, and position angle fixed at the observed values. Although perturbation from cluster galaxies is an essential component in the model, the proximity of the observed arcs to cluster galaxies is not small enough to constrain their model parameters, meaning that a large region in the galaxy parameter space is allowed by the constraints. We therefore report the best-fit value and the range that was set as prior instead of a formal uncertainty.</p>\n<p>The best-fit model is found in an iterative manner. We start with an optimization in the source plane, allowing all the parameters to vary as described above. The resulting best-fit model is used as an initial guess in the final modeling process, using image-plane optimization. Since the cluster-member parameters are not constrained by the observed data, we fix them at &sigma;&ast; &equals; 120&nbsp;km&nbsp;s<sup>&minus;1</sup> and <italic>r</italic>&ast;<sub>cut</sub> &equals; 30&nbsp;kpc.

An initial lens model predicted a counter image &sim;30&Prime; north of the BCG (S7c), which is detected in the data with excellent morphological resemblance to the model-predicted image. We thus include the three images of S7 (S7a and S7b, which form a merging-pair radial arc, and S7c) as additional constraints. We set a prior on the redshift of this source to be larger than 1.7, as its critical curve, which is tightly constrained by the two arcs that form the radial arc, indicates that it is at a higher redshift than the primary giant arc. The modeling process predicts a redshift of 2.29<sup>&plus;0.08</sup><sub>&minus; 0.05</sub> for this source. By including the three images of S7 in the model we are able to significantly reduce the uncertainty in model parameters, and consequently in the magnifications, from &sim;50&percnt; to &sim;10&percnt;. Detailed simulations, in which we model the cluster assuming that the redshift of S7 is known, indicate that securing a spectroscopic redshift for S7 would further reduce the magnification uncertainty to the few-percent level. This agrees with the results of Jullo et al. (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"apj417477r6\">2007</xref>), who tested simulated lens potential parameter degeneracies, and with Miralda-Escude (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"apj417477r12\">1995</xref>), who showed that radial arcs and their counter images provide a stringent constraint on the profile shape as well as the enclosed mass. Thus, while S7 already improves the magnification uncertainties by a factor of five (relative to a model constrained only by the primary giant arc and the counter image), measuring a redshift for it is an obvious high priority, since it would further improve the model uncertainties to &lt;10&percnt;.</p>\n<p>In total, we have 44 constraints and 19 free parameters, resulting in an overconstrained model. In the future, one might be able to include additional substructure in the cluster mass distribution to make the ultimate lens model. For now, we choose to not include substructure whose existence is not directly motivated by an observed counterpart.</p></sec>\n<sec id=\"apj417477s3-3\"><label>3.3.</label><title>Source Reconstruction</title>\n<p>The source-plane reconstruction is done by ray-tracing the pixels in the observed frame through the lensing potential of the best-fit lens model (see Figures <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"apj417477f2\">2</xref> and <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"apj417477f3\">3</xref>). In the process, we preserve the spatial information by allowing de-lensed pixels to have arbitrary shapes and sizes. The source reconstruction is used as a tool to understand the mapping between the distorted images of the multiply lensed source and the source itself. The location of the source galaxy with respect to the source-plane caustics determines the geometry, multiplicity, and parity of each of its lensed images. As in many cases of giant arcs, the source galaxy is positioned such that a caustic crosses it, resulting in a high magnification. In the case of RCSGA 032727-132609, as can be seen in Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"apj417477f2\">2</xref>, the caustic that corresponds to the NE tangential critical curve separates the source into two general parts. The part that lies inside the caustic is multiply imaged five times: its instances are images 1, 2, and part of images 3, 4, and 5. The part of the source that remains outside the caustic is multiply imaged only three times, in images 3, 4, and 5, and &ldquo;vanishes&rdquo; in the merging-pair images 1 and 2. The bright region that extends to both sides of the critical curve between images 1 and 2 is in fact mapped to an extremely small area in the source, directly inward to the caustic. This source-plane to image-plane mapping may be best understood from Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"apj417477f3\">3</xref>, which shows four separate reconstructions of the source, each one from a different lensed image. In Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"apj417477f4\">4</xref> (and the inset in Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"apj417477f1\">1</xref>), we merge these four reconstructions by combining the best-resolved segments of the source into one frame. Note that a faint area at the &ldquo;left&rdquo; edge of the source, which crosses back into the critical curve (designated by label A in Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"apj417477f4\">4</xref>), is also highly magnified to form the faint tangential arc labeled as A in Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"apj417477f2\">2</xref>.</p>\n<fig id=\"apj417477f3\" position=\"float\" fig-type=\"color\">\n<label>Figure 3.</label>\n<caption><p>Source reconstruction from each of the magnified images of RCSGA 032727-132609.

Using the new lens model, we map out the magnification of the highly magnified arc RCSGA 032727-132609 and construct a de-lensed image of the source galaxy. Due to the location of the galaxy in the source plane with respect to the lensing caustics, parts of the source are multiply imaged five times, while other parts are multiply imaged only three times in a merging-pair configuration. In particular, we find that the brightest parts of the giant arc, which were targeted for rest-frame optical spectroscopy by R11, are lensed images of a small region of the source galaxy (&sim;10&percnt; of the spatial size of the galaxy).</p>\n<p>The resolution of the <italic>HST</italic> data allows us to uniquely identify features in the different lensed images of the source and identify additional lensed galaxies. The resultant lens model is superior to the previously published lens model (Wuyts et al. <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"apj417477r17\">2010</xref>) based on ground-based data. To quantify this claim, we compare the magnification uncertainty between models, a value that is crucial for understanding the physical conditions in the source galaxy through a measurement of the intrinsic, unlensed, luminosity (see Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"apj417477f8\">8</xref>). Since the ground-based lens model was not robust enough to measure the magnification of the giant arc directly, we concentrate on the easier to measure, less sensitive magnification of its counter image. In the top panel, we plot a histogram of the magnifications that were derived from a suit of simulated lens models, with parameters drawn from MCMC steps in this work. The same is shown in the bottom panel, for the model published in Wuyts et al. (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"apj417477r17\">2010</xref>). The magnifications in each set are divided by the magnifications from the best-fit models to enable the comparison. We find that even in the case of the counter image, the magnification uncertainty improves by a factor of four when using high-resolution <italic>HST</italic> data. We emphasize that the model presented in Wuyts et al. (<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"apj417477r17\">2010</xref>) is based on wrong assumptions about the mapping of the counter images to each other; in particular, the brightest emission knot marked g in Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"apj417477f1\">1</xref> was assumed to have a counter image in images 1 (Aa) and 2 (Ab) of the giant arc, whereas we now understand that this is not the case. Thus, the magnification that was derived from it was not accurate, and the uncertainty was probably underestimated.</p>\n<fig id=\"apj417477f8\" position=\"float\">\n<label>Figure 8.</label>\n<caption><p>Comparison of the magnification uncertainty between a lens model based on <italic>HST</italic> data (this work) and a lens model based on ground-based data (Wuyts et al. <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"apj417477r17\">2010</xref>).

Based on this magnification, we find that the average SFR within the aperture is 29 &plusmn; 8, significantly lower than the value we reported in R11, a value that was estimated under the assumption that the source is uniform and the sampled region is representative of the entire source. We remind the reader that this knowingly wrong assumption was the only possible assumption at the time, with only a preliminary mass model in hand. In R11, the SFR was estimated by multiplying the flux by the luminosity-weighted fraction of the galaxy that is covered by the slit, and dividing by the average magnification of the giant arc. This procedure results in an effective magnification which is several times too small and implies an extremely high SFR for the entire source. In practice, the region sampled by the slit, as illustrated in Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"apj417477f6\">6</xref>, represents only about 10&percnt; of the physical size of the source; it does not cover the brightest part of the source and is probably not representative of the entire galaxy, as we suspected in R11. The higher value of this updated magnification reinforces the usefulness of RCSGA 032727-132609 for probing down the luminosity function at high redshift, particularly with ALMA.</p>\n<p>The results shown in this paper allow the precise mapping of the knots in the arc to the source plane for the first time. This work enables many other investigations. In an upcoming paper, we will analyze spectra on a knot-by-knot basis to study the degree to which physical conditions vary across the arc. We also intend to use the high-resolution <italic>HST</italic> imaging presented in this paper to map on a pixel-by-pixel basis the SED, SFR, and extinction of the source, which we defer to a future paper. Further spectroscopy should provide secure redshifts for one or more of the secondary arcs, which will reduce the uncertainty in model parameters and the magnification to the few-percent level, making RCSGA 032727-132609 one of the best understood lensed high-<italic>z</italic> galaxies.</p></sec></body>\n<back>\n<ack><p>Support for program 12267 was provided by NASA through a grant from the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.

In the process, we preserve the spatial information by allowing de-lensed pixels to have arbitrary shapes and sizes. The source reconstruction is used as a tool to understand the mapping between the distorted images of the multiply lensed source and the source itself. The location of the source galaxy with respect to the source-plane caustics determines the geometry, multiplicity, and parity of each of its lensed images. As in many cases of giant arcs, the source galaxy is positioned such that a caustic crosses it, resulting in a high magnification. In the case of RCSGA 032727-132609, as can be seen in Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"apj417477f2\">2</xref>, the caustic that corresponds to the NE tangential critical curve separates the source into two general parts. The part that lies inside the caustic is multiply imaged five times: its instances are images 1, 2, and part of images 3, 4, and 5. The part of the source that remains outside the caustic is multiply imaged only three times, in images 3, 4, and 5, and &ldquo;vanishes&rdquo; in the merging-pair images 1 and 2. The bright region that extends to both sides of the critical curve between images 1 and 2 is in fact mapped to an extremely small area in the source, directly inward to the caustic. This source-plane to image-plane mapping may be best understood from Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"apj417477f3\">3</xref>, which shows four separate reconstructions of the source, each one from a different lensed image. In Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"apj417477f4\">4</xref> (and the inset in Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"apj417477f1\">1</xref>), we merge these four reconstructions by combining the best-resolved segments of the source into one frame. Note that a faint area at the &ldquo;left&rdquo; edge of the source, which crosses back into the critical curve (designated by label A in Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"apj417477f4\">4</xref>), is also highly magnified to form the faint tangential arc labeled as A in Figure <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"apj417477f2\">2</xref>."}, "Pandas format": {"Table 2": {"Status": "Complete", "Action": "Processed via pandas", "Inspection": {"Notes": {"Skip cause table not important": ""}}}}}, "Table set 1": {"Link": "/uufs/chpc.utah.edu/common/home/astro/brownstein/talbot/research/silo/data/tables_backup/hand_from_dropbox/ApJ/746/161/apj417477t1_ascii.txt", "Response": "Table 1\nBest-fit Lens Model Parameters\n\nHalo\tR.A.\tDecl.\te\ttheta\tr_core\tr_cut\tsigma_0\t\n(PIEMD)\t(\")\t(\")\t\t(deg)\t(kpc)\t(kpc)\t(km s^-1)\t\nCluster\t-2.23^+0.14_- 0.20\t-2.03^+0.12_- 0.13\t0.40^+0.03_- 0.02\t9.1^+0.5_- 0.4\t55^+5_- 4\t[2000]\t1139^+17_- 14\t\nBCG\t0.03 [-0.05 0.05]\t-0.02 [-0.05 0.05]\t0.19 [0.00 0.30]\t153 [0 180]\t0.5 [0.0 2.0]\t[40]\t258^+38_- 29\t\nGal 1\t[9.426]\t[9.306]\t[0.54]\t[63.3]\t[0.08]\t6 [1 25]\t85 [10 100]\t\nGal 2\t[8.684]\t[7.587]\t[0.22]\t[163.4]\t[0.004]\t3 [1 25]\t86 [10 100]\t\nL* galaxy\t ... \t ... \t ... \t ... \t[0.15]\t30 [0 70]\t120 [50 150]\t\n\n", "Status": "Complete", "Action": "Scanned all subtables", "Table captions or footers": {"Overview": "Table 1\nBest-fit Lens Model Parameters"}, "Pandas format": {"Table 2": {"Status": "Complete", "Action": "Processed via pandas", "Inspection": {"Notes": {"Skip cause table not important": ""}}}}}}, "Tables status": "Complete", "Inspection status": "Complete"}

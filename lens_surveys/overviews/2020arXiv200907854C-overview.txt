Starting from 101,353 variable objects with $\\textit{i}$-band difference images in the HSC transient survey, we use a time-variability-based lens search method measuring the spatial extendedness in difference images to select potential lensed quasar candidates. We adopt conservative constraints in this variability selection and obtain 83,657 variable objects as possible lens candidates. We then run CHITAH, a lens search algorithm based on the image configuration, on those 83,657 variable objects, and 2,130 variable objects are identified as lensed objects. We visually inspect the 2,130 variable objects, and seven of them are our final candidates of lensed quasars. Additionally, we find one lensed galaxy candidate as a serendipitous discovery. Among the eight final lensed candidates, one is the only known quadruply lensed quasar in the survey field, HSCJ095921+020638. None of the other seven lensed candidates has been previously classified as a lens nor a lensed candidate. Three of the five final candidates with available Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images, including HSCJ095921+020638, show clues of lensed feature in the HST images. A tightening of variability selection criteria might result in the loss of possible lensed quasar candidates, especially the lensed quasars with faint brightness or narrow separation, without efficiently eliminating the non-lensed objects; CHITAH is therefore important as an advanced examination to improve the lens search efficiency through the object configuration. The recovery of HSCJ095921+020638 proves the feasibility of the time-variability-based lens search method, and this lens search method can be used in other cadenced imaging surveys, such as the upcoming Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time.", "custom1": "eprint: arXiv:2009.07854"}}

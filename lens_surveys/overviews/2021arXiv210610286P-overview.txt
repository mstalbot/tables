The MUSE observations provide redshift estimates for the lensed sources and help reducing the mis-identification of the multiple images. Spectroscopic data are also used to measure the inner velocity dispersions of 15 cluster galaxies and calibrate the scaling relations to model the subhalo cluster component. The model is based on 62 multiple images grouped in 17 families belonging to 4 different sources. The majority of them are multiple images of compact stellar knots belonging to a single star-forming galaxy at z=2.3702. This source is strongly lensed by the cluster to form the Sunburst Arc system. To accurately reproduce all the multiple images, we build a parametric mass model, which includes both cluster-scale and galaxy-scale components. The resulting model has a r.m.s. separation between the model-predicted and the observed positions of the multiple images of only 0.14''. We conclude that PSZ1 G311.65-18.48 has a relatively round projected shape and a large Einstein radius (29'' for z_s = 2.3702), which could indicate that the cluster is elongated along the line of sight. The Sunburst Arc source is located at the intersection of a complex network of caustics, which explains why parts of the arc are imaged with unprecedented multiplicity (up to 12 times).", "custom1": "eprint: arXiv:2106.10286"}, "ADS link": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv210610286P", "Publisher link via ADS gateway": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/link_gateway/2021arXiv210610286P/EPRINT_HTML", "Action": "Did not process since arXiv."}

However, these objects are rare and challenging to discover due to requirements of high-angular resolution astrometric, multiwavelength photometric and spectroscopic data. This has limited the number of known systems to a few hundred objects. We aim to reduce the constraints on angular resolution and discover multiply-imaged QSO candidates by using new candidate selection principles based on unresolved photometric time-series and ground-based images from public surveys. We selected candidates for multiply-imaged QSOs based on low levels of entropy computed from Catalina unresolved photometric time-series or Euclidean similarity to known lenses in a space defined by the wavelet power spectra of Pan-STARSS DR2 or DECaLS DR7 images, combined with multiple {\\it Gaia} DR2 sources or large astrometric errors and supervised and unsupervised learning methods. We then confirmed spectroscopically some candidates with the Palomar Hale, Keck-I, and ESO/NTT telescopes. Here we report the discovery and confirmation of seven doubly-imaged QSOs and one likely double quasar. This demonstrates the potential of combining space-astrometry, even if unresolved, with low spatial-resolution photometric time-series and/or low-spatial resolution multi-band imaging to discover multiply-imaged lensed QSOs.", "custom1": "eprint: arXiv:1912.08977"}}

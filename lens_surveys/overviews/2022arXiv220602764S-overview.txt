This is the third paper in a series (following Huang et al. 2020; Huang et al. 2021, Paper I & II, respectively). These surveys together cover $\\sim$ 19,000 deg$^2$ visible from the northern hemisphere, reaching a z-band AB magnitude of $\\sim$ 22.5. We use a deep residual neural network, trained on a compilation of known lensing systems and candidates as well as non-lenses in the same footprint. After applying our trained neural networks to the survey data, we visually inspect and rank images with probabilities above a threshold. We have found 1895 lens candidates. Out of these, 1512 are identified for the first time. Combining the discoveries from this work, Paper I (335) and II (1210), the total number of strong lens candidates from the Legacy Surveys that we have discovered is 3057.", "custom1": "eprint: arXiv:2206.02764"}, "ADS link": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022arXiv220602764S", "Publisher link via ADS gateway": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/link_gateway/2022arXiv220602764S/EPRINT_HTML", "Action": "Did not process since arXiv."}

This is very important given the recent discord in the value of H <SUB>0</SUB>) from two methods that probe different distance ranges. The success of this technique will rely of our ability to discover strongly lensed SNe with measurable time delays. Here, we present the magnifications and the time delays for the multiply-imaged galaxies behind the Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) galaxy clusters, by using recently published lensing models. Continuing on our previous work done for Abell 1689 (A1689) and Abell 370, we also show the prospects of observing strongly lensed SNe behind the HFF clusters with the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). With four 1-hour visits in one year, the summed expectations of all six HFF clusters are 0.5 core-collapse (CC) SNe and 0.06 Type Ia SNe (SNe Ia) in F115W band, while with F150W the expectations are higher, 0.9 CC SNe and 0.06 SNe Ia. These estimates match those expected by only surveying A1689, proving that the performance of A1689 as gravitational telescope is superior. In the five HFF clusters presented here, we find that F150W will be able to detect SNe Ia (SNe IIP) exploding in 93 (80) pairsmultiply-imaged galaxies with time delays of less than 5 years.", "doi": "10.1134/S1063772918120272", "custom1": "eprint: arXiv:1901.02014", "issn": "1063-7729", "number": "12"}}

Given absolute magnitudes of M<SUB>145, AB</SUB> = -29.3, M<SUB>300, AB</SUB> = -30.12, and logL<SUB>bol</SUB>/L<SUB>bol, \u2609</SUB> = 14.84, it is the quasi-stellar object with the highest unlensed UV-optical luminosity currently known in the Universe. It was found by combining proper-motion data from Gaia DR2 with photometry from SkyMapper DR1 and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. In the GAIA database, it is an isolated single source and thus unlikely to be strongly gravitationally lensed. It is also unlikely to be a beamed source as it is not discovered in the radio domain by either NRAO-VLA Sky Survey or Sydney University Molonglo Southern Survey. It is classed as a weak-emission-line quasi-stellar object and possesses broad absorption line features. A lightcurve from ATLAS spanning the time from 2015 October to 2017 December shows little sign of variability.", "doi": "10.1017/pasa.2018.22", "custom1": "eprint: arXiv:1805.04317", "issn": "1323-3580"}}

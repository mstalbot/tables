Galaxies behind clusters can be distorted by the lenses to form arcs in images. Herein a search was done for giant lensed arcs using the SDSS data. By visually inspecting SDSS images of newly identified clusters in the SDSS DR8 and Stripe 82 data, we discover 8 strong lensing clusters together with additional 3 probable and 6 possible cases. The lensed arcs show bluer colors than the member galaxies of clusters. The masses and optical luminosities of galaxy clusters interior to the arcs are calculated. The mass-to-light ratios are found to be in the range of a few tens of M <SUB>\u2609</SUB>/ L <SUB>\u2609</SUB>, consistent with the distribution of previously known lensing clusters.", "doi": "10.1007/s11433-014-5544-8", "custom1": "eprint: arXiv:1310.4885", "number": "9"}}

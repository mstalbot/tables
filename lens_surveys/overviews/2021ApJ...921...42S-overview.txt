This paper reports on the 12 quadruply imaged quasars identified by this effort to date, which is a ~20% increase in the total number of confirmed quadruply imaged quasars. We discuss the candidate selection, spectroscopic follow-up, and lens modeling. We also report our spectroscopic failures as an aid for future investigations.", "doi": "10.3847/1538-4357/ac0f04", "custom1": "eprint: arXiv:2012.10051", "issn": "0004-637X", "number": "1"}, "ADS link": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...921...42S", "Publisher link via ADS gateway": "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/link_gateway/2021ApJ...921...42S/PUB_HTML", "Action": "Aborted since: Blocked.

Black dots represent galaxies  identified as cluster members by both the P+G and Clean algorithms. Open circles  represent galaxies identified as cluster members by the P+G algorithm only. Squares  represent galaxies identified as cluster members by the Clean algorithm only.  Crosses represent noncluster members. Bottom panel: cluster members  selected with the P+G method in the projected phase-space diagram,  R,vrf. Red circles represent passive  galaxies, blue stars represent SF galaxies. In both panels the vertical (magenta)  line indicates r200,U, i.e. the  r200 value obtained by scaling the  r\u0394 estimate of U12 at \u0394\u00a0=\u00a0200, using their best-fit NFW profile.","1":"In the text"}}

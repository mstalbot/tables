Projected total mass (cumulative, left panel) and mass density (right panel) profiles rescaled by the quantities M200c and R200c from independent weak lensing measurements. In addition to the four galaxy clusters with the best strong lensing models presented in this work (i.e., the gold sample), we also show the profiles of MACS J1206, Abell 1063 and MACS J0416, the last one is known to be a prominent merging cluster. The vertical lines indicate the distances from the cluster centers of the multiple images belonging to the spectroscopically confirmed families."}}

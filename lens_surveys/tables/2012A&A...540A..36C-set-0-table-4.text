From top to bottom are SDSS\u00a0J0827+5224, SDSS\u00a0J0919+2720, and SDSS\u00a0J1005+4016. The emission lines are labelled as in Fig.\u00a01. For each object the two panels correspond to the spectra obtained in the blue and red channels of the LRIS spectrograph. All spectra are shown in the observed frame. They have not been corrected for telluric absorption.","1":"Open with DEXTER"}}

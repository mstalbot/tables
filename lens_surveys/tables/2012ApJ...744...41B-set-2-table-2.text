The features are diffuse but significant.","10":"Clear image and counterimage. Possible foreground subtraction artifacts affect the counterimage in the north due to proximity to the lens center. Fixing the mass axis ratio to the light axis ratio increases model theta_E by 0&farcs;03.","11":"Well-modeled compact arc and counterimage.","12":"Well-modeled extended arc with a compact counterimage.","13":"Well-modeled arc and a compact counterimage. Lens galaxy has a slightly disturbed morphology in its core.","14":"Double image lens with detailed feature correspondence reproduced by the pixelized source plane model.","15":"Double image lens with feature correspondence.","16":"Well-modeled compact double. Diffuse component to the west reproduced by the pixelized model.","17":"Well-modeled arc and counterarc.","18":"Complex quad\/double transition.

There is a galaxy group 10\" to the east that may contribute shear at the lens position and account for the model shortcomings.","26":"Plausibly modeled image and counterimage, including substructure reproduced by the pixelized source model. Classified grade-B because of the low surface brightness and the significant bright star light contamination in the south.","27":"Very faint possible Einstein-ring features, but the surface brightness and S\/N are too low for modeling.","28":"Very plausible image-counterimage pair to the northwest and southeast, with detailed feature correspondence, but the group environment of the lens complicates modeling and interpretation.","29":"Likely background features seen in the residual image, but no counterimages.","30":"Likely background features seen in the residual image, but no counterimages.","31":"Extended source to south inconsistent with the compact source to the north as image-counterimage pair.","32":"Clear distorted arc, but no detected counterimage.","33":"Tangentially elongated image to the northeast with no detected counterimage.","34":"Disky late-type structure with lensed arc to the east, but no apparent counterimage.","35":"Clear evidence of background galaxy to the west, but no evidence of a counterimage.","36":"Pronounced asymmetry in the lens-galaxy brightness profile; plausible background-galaxy arc to the southwest, but no evidence of a counterimage."},"Unnamed: 3":{"0":"","1":"","2":"","3":"","4":"","5":"","6":"","7":"","8":"","9":"","10":"","11":"","12":"","13":"","14":"","15":"","16":"","17":"","18":"","19":"","20":"","21":"","22":"","23":"","24":"","25":"","26":"","27":"","28":"","29":"","30":"","31":"","32":"","33":"","34":"","35":"","36":""}}

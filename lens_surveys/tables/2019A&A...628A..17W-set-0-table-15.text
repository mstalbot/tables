The gray shaded regions depict the contribution of the SPT to the error budget. The solid line corresponds to images C\u2212D, the dashed line to C\u2212A, and the dotted line to C\u2212B. For the sake of clarity, we shifted upwards the time delays between images C\u2212A (dashed line) by a three-day offset.","1":"Open with DEXTER","2":"In the text"}}

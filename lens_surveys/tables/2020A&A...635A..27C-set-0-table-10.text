The fit is performed using the filled symbols, circles are photometric points, and diamonds are points obtained averaging the X-shooter spectra over a range of wavelengths. The best fit to the data is shown as a solid line. The subpanels show the difference between the data points and the best-fit models. In each inset panel, we show the position of the component (plain color) in the SFR-M* diagram along with the MS at z\u2004=\u20041.5 from Schreiber et al. (2015). The position of the second component is also indicated in light color for comparison. Both components are located below the MS.","1":"Open with DEXTER"}}

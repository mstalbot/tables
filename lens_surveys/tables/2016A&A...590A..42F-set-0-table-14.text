The dark continuous line shows the fit model used in our simulations. The light gray markers show the best fit parameters for \u03a6\u2217 and M\u2217 when fitting the LF separately in each redshift bin, without any evolution model constraints. When constraining the evolution of the characteristic density, the best parameters are found to be log\u2009\u03a6\u2217 ,lowz = \u22125.85, \u03b1\u03a6\u2217 = \u22120.77 \u00b1 0.31, and zref = 2.09 \u00b1 0.28.","1":"Open with DEXTER","2":"In the text"}}

HST image cutouts with the circular aperture (green circle) we use to extract the image spectra and the relevant spectral details for some multiple images in the A2163 core. The panels of each column refer to the same family and (from the top to the bottom) to the images a, b, and c, respectively. In Table 2, QFs for all multiple images are reported. The spectral line doublets (in gray) are [C III] for the first two columns and [O II] for the last one."}}

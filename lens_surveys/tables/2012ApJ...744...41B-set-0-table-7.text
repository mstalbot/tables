Possible lensed background sources cannot be unambiguously modeled given single-band imaging.","3":"Double nucleus in the foreground galaxy, with no evidence of background-galaxy features.","4":"Faint possible background-galaxy features to the west, but without plausible evidence of strong lensing.","5":"Possible candidate arc extending to the northwest and to the east, but the system is difficult to interpret as a lens.","6":"No obvious background features, but spiral structure and\/or dust in the foreground galaxy complicates interpretation.","7":"Possible faint background-galaxy features to the northeast, but without evidence of strong lensing."}}

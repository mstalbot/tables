X-ray surface brightness contours from XMM-Newton are overlaid in white. Spectroscopic cluster members are marked by green circles; only five out of six are visible in the region shown, the sixth member is ~760 kpc to the E-SE of the BCG. Red squares mark the position of the three confirmed multiple images, while we show in red the critical curve for zs\u00a0=\u00a01.6. The thin cyan box shows the slit used to get the spectrum of the arc (1\u2033 across); the wide cyan box shows the zoomed-in region in the left panel of Fig. 2. The thick white line in the bottom right corner shows a 30\u2033 scale, corresponding to 188 kpc at z\u00a0=\u00a00.516.","1":"Open with DEXTER","2":"In the text"}}

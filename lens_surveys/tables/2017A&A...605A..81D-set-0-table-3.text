The studied galaxy at zCO = 3.6314, strongly lensed by the galaxy cluster MACS\u2009J0032.1+1808, is composed of six multiple images well resolved in the HST image, labeled A, B, C, D, E, and F and encircled in white. They form a giant arc extending over 42.4\u2032\u2032. The right panels show, respectively, the zoom-in color-composite image obtained using the Spitzer\/IRAC 3.6 and 4.5 \u03bcm bands over the multiple images B, C, D, E, and F (top) and the zoom-out color-composite image obtained using the Herschel\/SPIRE 250, 350, and 500 \u03bcm bands; the white box represents a 40\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 40\u2032\u2032 area.","1":"Open with DEXTER"}}

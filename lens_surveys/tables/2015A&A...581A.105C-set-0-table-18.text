Bottom: CO emission-line luminosity as a function of FWHM line width, using the same symbols as in the top panel, with additional light blue dots showing those sources of Bothwell et al. (2013), which are neither gravitationally lensed nor AGN hosts. The solid and dashed lines show the best linear fit to the sample of field galaxies, as well as shifts of this line corresponding to magnification factors of 5, 10, and 20. Error bars show the 1\u03c3 uncertainties of our single-component Gaussian line fits.","1":"Open with DEXTER","2":"In the text"}}

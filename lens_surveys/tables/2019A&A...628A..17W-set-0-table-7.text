The black dots locate the image positions, and their size mimics the associated flux, as reported in the Gaia DR2. The solid line represents the tangential critical line, the diamond-shaped dashed line represents the corresponding caustic line, and the dotted line defines the direction of the external shear. Finally, the color map shows how the surface mass density \u03ba is distributed.","1":"Open with DEXTER"}}

Black dots locate the astrometric positions from Gaia DR2. The numbers associated with each position indicate the G band flux ratios with respect to the brightest image. The leftmost chart corresponds to the well-known lens HE0435\u20131223. The following three systems are our newly discovered quadruply-imaged candidates, and an independent rediscovery of a recently reported system, from Gaia DR2 data alone. Several products obtained from our simple lens modeling are represented: the critical curves (red), the caustics (black), the source positions (red crosses), and the predicted deflector centroids (black squares).","1":"Open with DEXTER","2":"In the text"}}

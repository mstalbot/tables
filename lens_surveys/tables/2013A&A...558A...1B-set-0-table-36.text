{"0":{"0":null,"1":"In the text"},"1":{"0":"Fig. 15  Velocity-anisotropy profile, \u03b2(r), of different  cluster galaxy populations. Top panel: all cluster members. The solid  (white) curve is the solution of the inversion of the Jeans equation adopting the  reference mass profile defined in Sect. 3.3. The  hatched (gray) region indicates the 1\u03c3 confidence region around this  solution. For comparison, three \u03b2(r) models are  shown (black curves). They correspond to the best-fit  \u03b2(r) models of the MAMPOSSt analysis for a NFW  M(r) model (see Sect. 3.1), namely (from top to bottom at small radii) the C, T, and O  model. In both panels, the vertical dashed and dash-dotted (magenta) lines indicate  the location of r-2 and r200,  respectively, and the horizontal dotted line indicates \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a00.  Bottom panel: passive and SF cluster members, separately. The red  solid (resp. blue dash-dotted) curve and orange (resp. cyan) hatched region represent  the solution of the inversion of the Jeans equation within the 1\u03c3  confidence region for passive (resp. SF) cluster members.","1":"In the text"}}

The profile for the SF galaxy population has been multiplied by 3.7 to  allow for a direct comparison with the profile of the passive galaxy population. The  hatched (orange) region indicates the 1\u03c3 confidence level of the  profile of the passive population (that for the SF population is not shown, but it is  much larger).","1":"In the text"}}

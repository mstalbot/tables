Left panels refer to strong lensing models using only spectroscopic families (L1, W1); models in the right panels include all families (L2, W2). Red lines: contours from Planck Data Release 2 data. Blue regions: combined constraints. The yellow circles indicate the maximum likelihood peak in this projection.","1":"In the text"}}

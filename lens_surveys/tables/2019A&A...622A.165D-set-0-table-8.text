The upper panels show the entire ROC curves, whereas the lower panels concentrate on the low FPR regions of each curve. The classification performances of each model is evaluated through the computation of the area under each of the TS\u2013ROC and VS\u2013ROC curves (AUC).","1":"Open with DEXTER","2":"In the text"}}

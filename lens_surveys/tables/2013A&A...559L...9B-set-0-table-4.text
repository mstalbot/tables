{"0":{"0":null,"1":"Open with DEXTER"},"1":{"0":"Fig. 2Spatial profiles along the direction of the slit for the spectra of ID3, derived by collapsing counts in the dispersion direction between and for each pointing separately. P1 is plotted in blue, P3 in red, and P2 and P4 in black. The continuum is clearly detected in P1 (5) and P3 (3). Spectra are generally at slightly different pixel positions in different pointings.","1":"Open with DEXTER"}}

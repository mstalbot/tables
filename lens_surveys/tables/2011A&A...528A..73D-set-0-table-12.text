{"0":{"0":null},"1":{"0":"Fig.\u200910  Median values of the dPIE truncation radius rcut vs. the characteristic dPIE central velocity dispersion \u03c30 for the galaxies that perturb the strong lensing system of Abell\u00a0611. The red triangles show the results obtained linking the galaxy parameters to the same scaling relation in the lens modelling (Case 4 in Table\u00a05), while the blue stars represent the results obtained optimising the galaxies individually (Case 6 in Table\u00a05). The grey dashed lines show the iso-density contours. The error bars indicate the 1\u03c3 uncertainty, while the cyan boxes indicate the 3\u03c3 confidence region for the results which refer to Case 4."}}

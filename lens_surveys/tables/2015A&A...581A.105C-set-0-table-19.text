Red dots show our data points, where the error bars along the abscissa indicate the width of each band. The error bars along the ordinate are often smaller than the symbol size. Green downward arrows show the 90% completeness limit of the IRAS all-sky survey at 60 and 100 \u03bcm, respectively. Red downward arrows at 22 \u03bcm show the 5\u03c3 upper limits provided by the WISE catalogs, where the counterparts were fainter than the 5.4 mJy flux limit of the WISE catalog. Black, blue, and yellow lines show the starburst and AGN component (if an AGN was fitted), and the sum of both, respectively.","1":"Open with DEXTER","2":"In the text"}}

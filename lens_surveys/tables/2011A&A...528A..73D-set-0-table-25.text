The numbering of the cases corresponds to the numbering in Table\u00a05. The red point distribution marks the 3\u03c3 confidence level for the two parameters. The green stars indicate the best-fit values; the error-bars refer to the 1\u03c3 statistical uncertainty. We used the same knot systems as inputs and the same priors on the cluster halo mass distribution in all the six cases; the only differences were the modelling and the parameterisation of the cluster galaxies and of the BCG. The probability distribution in case 4 appears squeezed because it crushed on the lower limit for the BCG characteristic central velocity dispersion. The lens model results for the cases shown here are listed in Table\u00a05.","1":"In the text"}}

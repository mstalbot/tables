{"0":{"0":null,"1":"Open with DEXTER"},"1":{"0":"Fig. 10Infrared luminosities (LIR) as a function of molecular gas mass for our sources. Red, yellow, and purple stars indicate the measured values (uncorrected for gravitational amplification), and the same values corrected by fiducial lensing factors of 10 and 50, respectively. In agreement with the dust-to-gas ratios discussed in Sect. 9 we adopt the classical \u201cULIRG\u201d conversion factor \u03b1CO = 0.8 M\u2299\/ (K km s-1 pc2) for all sources. The blue and red line indicate the relationships for starbursts and \u201cmain-sequence\u201d galaxies emphasized by Daddi et al. (2010). Small dots show the low- and high-z samples of Daddi et al. (2010) for comparison. Light blue dots along the upper line show low- and high-z ULIRGs and SMGs, respectively. The filled dark green dots (with error bars) are BzK galaxies at z ~ 2; for details of these samples see Daddi et al. (2010). All error bars include the measurement uncertainties. The black cross in the lower right corner of the plot shows a fiducial factor 2 in statistical uncertainty.","1":"Open with DEXTER"}}

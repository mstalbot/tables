The encircled data points correspond to MS SFGs with measured gas-phase metallicities. Five redshift bins are considered: z ~ 0, z = [ 0.055,0.4 ], z = [ 1,1.6 ], z = [ 2,2.5 ], and z = [ 2.7,3.6 ]. The corresponding mean values of tdepl are shown as large black crosses with the associated 1\u03c3 dispersion as standard deviation. Magenta crosses represent tdepl values from B\u00e9thermin et al. (2015) derived from the FIR dust continuum and by adopting the same mass-metallicity relation (Eq. (4)). The observed evolution of tdepl with redshift is parametrized by a power law; the best fit, 1.15(1 + z)-0.85, is shown as a solid line.","1":"Open with DEXTER","2":"In the text"}}

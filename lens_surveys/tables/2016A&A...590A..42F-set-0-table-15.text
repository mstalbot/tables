Right: DNCF as a function of the G-band magnitude. We use a combined observational sample of the SDSS-DR3 and 2QZ\/6QZ for magnitudes brighter (fainter) than i ~ 19, converted to G-band magnitudes and thus assuming the DNCF shape in G-band to be similar. We also show the fit used to estimate the DNCF.","1":"Open with DEXTER","2":"In the text"}}

{"0":{"0":null},"1":{"0":"Fig.\u20091  (Left panel) F606W ACS\/HST image of the cluster Abell\u00a0611 (see Table\u00a03 for the observation summary). The X-ray isophotes derived from the Chandra image (shown in the middle panel) are overlaid in white. The green cross indicates the X-ray centroid. (Middle panel) The Chandra X-ray image of Abell\u00a0611 in the energy range [0.25\u20137.0]\u00a0keV. The image was smoothed with a 3\u00a0pixel FWHM Gaussian filter, and is not exposure-corrected. The contours derived from the HST image (shown in the left panel) are overlaid in white to facilitate the comparison between the images. Here again the green cross marks the X-ray centroid. (Right panel) Pseudo-colour composite image of Abell\u00a0611, obtained combining r and g-SLOAN images, taken with the Large Binocular Camera mounted at LBT. The three panels are WCS-aligned; the size of the field of view is \u2243 [1.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01.8] arcmin."}}

They are composed of three and four images that pass the soft astrometric test (see Sect. 2) that have a maximum angular separation between components that is smaller than 6\u2033, that have absolute differences in G magnitudes of < 4 mag, and that are found in regions of the celestial sphere where the mean field density is lower than 6 \u00d7 104 objects deg\u22122. Lower density regions near the galactic centre can be explained by the filtering occurring in the on-board processing in order to prevent memory from saturating in such very dense regions of the sky (Gaia Collaboration 2016).","1":"Open with DEXTER","2":"In the text"}}

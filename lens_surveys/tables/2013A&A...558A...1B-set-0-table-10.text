{"0":{"0":null},"1":{"0":"Fig. 8  Top panel: mass profiles as obtained from the MAMPOSSt and Caustic  analyses. The MAMPOSSt result is that obtained using the NFW model and the O  \u03b2(r) model, and is represented by a black curve  within a grey shaded area (1\u03c3 confidence region). The Caustic  result is represented by green dash-dotted curves (central value within  1\u03c3 confidence region). The black dot and green square represent  the locations of the  [r200,M200]  values for the MAMPOSSt and Caustic M(r).  Bottom panel: fractional difference between different mass  profiles and the MAMPOSSt best-fit to the NFW M(r)  with O \u03b2(r) model (displayed in the top panel).  The MAMPOSSt best-fit O \u03b2(r) Hernquist, Einasto,  and Burkert models are represented by the blue long-dashed, gold triple-dot-dashed,  and red short-dashed curves, respectively. The MAMPOSSt best-fit C  \u03b2(r) SIS model is represented by the magenta  dotted curve. The Caustic M(r) and  1\u03c3 confidence levels are represented by the green dash-dotted  curves. The solid line marks the zero and the grey shaded area the  1\u03c3 confidence region of the NFW model fit. Symbols represent the  location of the  [r200,M200\/MNFW(r200)\u00a0\u2212\u00a01]  values for the different mass profiles, NFW (filled black dot), Hernquist (blue X),  Einasto (gold star), Burkert (red triangle), SIS (magenta inverted triangle),  Caustic (green square). The NFW and Burkert values are barely visible in the plot,  because they are virtually indistinguishable from the Einasto and Hernquist values.  All MAMPOSSt results displayed here are for the  r\u03bd\u00a0=\u00a00.63 Mpc value (see Table  2)."}}

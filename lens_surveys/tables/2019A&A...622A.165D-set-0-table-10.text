They are ordered according to their ERT probabilities (upper left corner of each subplot). The common name of the known lenses is labelled in red in the lower left corner of each subplot, while the candidates we propose have their probabilities written in green fonts. Images [1], [2], [4\u20137], [9], [11], [13], [14], [16], [17], [19\u201323], [25\u201332] come from the Pan-STARRS survey (Chambers et al. 2016); images [12], [15], [18] come from the Digitized Sky Survey II (Lasker et al. 1996); and images [3], [8], [10], [24] come from the DES (Dark Energy Survey Collaboration et al. 2016). All images were collected from the ALADIN sky atlas (Bonnarel et al. 2000) in a field of view of 10.8\u2033\u2005\u00d7\u200510.8\u2033 centred around the mean coordinates of the GL where east is to the left and north is up. Points are scaled according to the relative flux of the components with respect to the brightest image of each configuration.","1":"Open with DEXTER","2":"In the text"}}

Gaia DR2 astrometry relative to the brightest image (A image) based on the original system discovery data is indicated by black points (except WGD2038-4008, see footnote in Table B.1). The numbers near each image, and the image size, indicate the flux ratios to the brightest image in the original system discovery data. We note that in some cases this may not be the brightest image detected by Gaia and therefore generates some flux ratios >1. North is up, east is left.","1":"Open with DEXTER"}}

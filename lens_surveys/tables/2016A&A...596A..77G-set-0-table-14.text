The A curve (red circles), the magnitude- and time-shifted B curve (blue circles), and the intrinsic spline (\u03b7int = 100 d; black line) are drawn together. The extrinsic spline (\u03b7ext = 50 d; blue line) describes the extrinsic variability correction that we apply to the curve B. The vertical ticks represent the knots.","1":"Open with DEXTER"}}

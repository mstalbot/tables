MUSE redshift is based on a clear, bright [|$\\rm{O\\,{\\small II}}$|] feature. Possible [|$\\rm{O\\,{\\small III}}$|] and H\u2009\u03b1 lines seen at the MUSE redshift in GLASS G141 data, though they are noisy.","1":"[|$\\rm{O\\,{\\small II}}$|], [|$\\rm{O\\,{\\small III}}$|], and H\u2009\u03b1 identified in GLASS, but very broad. Misalignment in the wavelength solution due to variance in the grism PA makes the redshift measurement uncertain. Better resolution in MUSE removes this uncertainty.","2":"Emission line at 9000\u2009\u00c5 originally identified as H\u2009\u03b1 in GLASS G102, but MUSE data reveals it to be [|$\\rm{O\\,{\\small III}}$|]. This is verified by additional emission lines seen at shorter wavelengths.","3":"Faint [|$\\rm{S\\,{\\small II}}$|] emission seen in GLASS G102 Band misidentified as H\u2009\u03b1. The actual H\u2009\u03b1 and [|$\\rm{S\\,{\\small II}}$|] emissions match those seen in MUSE."}}

Noise realizations based on the data are added to the simulated maps, and the absolute flux scaling is obtained by matching the observed flux at the peak of the emission in the counter-image C in each of the CO(1\u20130), CO(6\u20135), 5 GHz, and 2 mm simulated maps. The critical line is in red. The size and orientation of the beams are indicated by the dashed green ellipses. Contour levels start at 2\u03c3 and are spaced in steps of 1\u03c3 (as in Fig. 2).","1":"Open with DEXTER"}}

Contours show where the surface mass density equals 4, 7 \u00d7 1010M\u2299 arcsec-2. Middle: contribution from the smooth component only. Contours delineate where the surface mass density equals 4, 5.5, 6.0 \u00d7 1010M\u2299 arcsec-2. Bottom: contribution from the galaxies component only. Contours mark where the surface mass density equals 0.5, 2 \u00d7 1010M\u2299 arcsec-2. We note that the galaxies gain more weight in the cored mass model, in order to compensate for the smoothness of the underlying large-scale mass components. Each panel measures 260\u2032\u2032\u00d7 190\u2032\u2032.","1":"In the text"}}

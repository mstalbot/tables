To produce the plot, the curves are first sorted according to the depth of their absolute minimum \u03bc, indicated in the colour bar. Each black line (solid, dashed and dotted) represents a different subsample (see text for details). The coloured diamonds show the value of \u03f5 for the D3CS combined samples; the corresponding number of estimations are indicated in parenthesis.","1":"Open with DEXTER"}}

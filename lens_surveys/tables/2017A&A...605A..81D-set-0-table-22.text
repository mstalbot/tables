(2)\u2013(4), on stellar mass and redshift. The lines are the iso-redshift curves, color-coded as a function of redshift, for z = 0.5 to z = 3.5 in steps of \u0394z = 0.5: the solid sections correspond to , the dashed segments to , and the dotted portions to . The horizontal black line marks the Milky Way CO-to-H2 conversion factor. Small symbols represent the computed values for MACSJ0032-arc (red star) as well as the compilation of MS SFGs with CO measurements from the literature (Dessauges-Zavadsky et al. 2015). Large symbols correspond to the few MS SFGs for which gas-phase metallicities have been measured from rest-frame optical nebular lines. The symbols are color-coded according to galaxy redshift and their shapes indicate ratios (<1.5: circles, 1.5\u22122: triangles, and >2: squares and star).","1":"Open with DEXTER","2":"In the text"}}

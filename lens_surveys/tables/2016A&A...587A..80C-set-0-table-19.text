Spectroscopically confirmed multiple images are indicated in red; multiple images with no spectroscopic redshift in magenta. White circles indicate sources close to a cluster member, or possibly lensed by line-of-sight structures, or with not secure counter images. These last images are not used in the lens model. More information is provided in Table 1. The blue circle shows the position of the BCG. The multiple image ID 14e is only used in the model F1-5th; see Table 4.","1":"In the text"}}

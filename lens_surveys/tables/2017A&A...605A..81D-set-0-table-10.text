Overlaid are the CO(6\u20135) contours integrated over, respectively, the channels that define the blue component (blue contours) and the red component (red contours) of the double-peaked CO(6\u20135) line profile shown in Fig. 7. The color-coding is in units of integrated flux Jy km s-1 and starts at 2\u03c3. Contour levels also start at 2\u03c3 and are spaced in steps of 1\u03c3. A clear spatial offset between the blue and red contours is observed. The corresponding PdBI beam size of 1.94\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 1.62\u2032\u2032 is about the size of the individual counter-images themselves.","1":"Open with DEXTER"}}

The cyan-shaded regions indicate channels where positive emission is detected. These channels are used to derive the CO line integrated fluxes and the velocity-integrated and velocity-averaged maps shown in Figs. 2 and 8, respectively. The solid red lines show the single or double Gaussian profiles that best fit the observed CO line profiles. The zero velocity is set to zCO = 3.6314.","1":"Open with DEXTER","2":"In the text"}}

The top and middle panels display decompositions into four (C\u2009iii] narrow + C\u2009iii] broad + Si\u2009iii] + Al\u2009iii) and three (C\u2009iv narrow + C\u2009iv broad + He\u2009ii complex) Gaussians, respectively. The bottom panel incorporates the microlensing magnification ratios of the line cores: decomposition of carbon lines (filled black circles; see Sect. 3.2), standard stratification of the BLER (green circles; see Sect. 3.1) and non-standard stratification of the BLER (red circles; see Sect. 3.1). This last panel also shows the microlensing of the C\u2009iii] and C\u2009iv broad emission lines (open black circles).","1":"Open with DEXTER"}}

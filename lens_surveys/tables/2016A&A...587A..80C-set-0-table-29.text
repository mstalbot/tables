Red regions: the redshift values of the spectroscopically confirmed families are fixed. Grey regions: the redshift values of all families are left free. These correspond to models F2 and FZ2, respectively, in Table 4. The contours represent the 68%, 95.4%, and 99.7% confidence levels.","1":"In the text"}}

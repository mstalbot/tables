In each row, from left to right, we show (i) a color composite of the system, (ii) a color composite after subtraction of the QSO and of the central parts of its host galaxy, (iii) the F475W image after subtraction of the QSO and its host, (iv)\u00a0the F814W image after subtraction of the QSO and its host. The arrows and labels indicate the lensed structures described in Sect.\u00a07. Note that SDSS\u00a0J0013+1523 was already presented in Courbin et\u00a0al. (2010) but the present HST images do not clearly support the lensing nature of this object.","1":"Open with DEXTER"}}

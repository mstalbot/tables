Right: cumulative distribution \u03c4-1d\u03c4\/dz as a function of the lens redshift. We show the case for two different source redshifts (zs = 2 and 4) and three different values of the angular resolution parameter (\u03b8min = 0,0.6 and 1\u2032\u2032), modeling the deflectors by means of the SIS and SIE models.","1":"Open with DEXTER"}}

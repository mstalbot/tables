The coloured tiles show the fraction of discovered delays as a function of the photometric precision of the fainter quasar image and the true time delay of the system. Left panel shows results from the very conservative sec sample, and central panel shows the less pure secpla sample that includes delay candidates considered as plausible (see text). Right panel, also for secpla, doubles the number of observing seasons. In each panel, only tiles covering more than three light curve pairs are shown.","1":"Open with DEXTER","2":"In the text"}}

Left panel: comparison between the overall distribution and sources with high confidence redshifts (zconf\u2004=\u20042,\u20063), the latter before and after (\u2018unique\u2019) accounting for image multiplicity. Right panel: comparison between the overall distribution and the line-only sources (pure line emitters without any HST counterpart, see Sect. 3.9).","1":"In the text"}}

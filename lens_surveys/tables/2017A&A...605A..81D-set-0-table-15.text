The contribution of the counter-image F is negligible. X refers to a galaxy member of the lensing cluster. Contour levels start at 2\u03c3 and are spaced in steps of 1\u03c3, expect for IRAC 3.6 \u03bcm where the contours are in steps of 9, 16, 25, 36, 49\u03c3, etc. The SPIRE detection extends beyond the multiple images B, C, D, and E, as shown in Fig. 1, but peaks at 4\u03c3 over B, C, D, and E. The rms levels of the 2 mm, 5 GHz, CO(6\u20135), and CO(1\u20130) data are 57 \u03bcJy, 1.7 \u03bcJy, 93 mJy km s-1, and 6.2 mJy km s-1, respectively. The size and orientation of the beam are indicated by the dotted (PdBI) or filled (JVLA) red ellipse in the bottom right corner.","1":"Open with DEXTER","2":"In the text"}}

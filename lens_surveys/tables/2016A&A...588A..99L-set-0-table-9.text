Contours show where the surface mass density equals 4, 7 \u00d7 1010\u2009M\u2299 arcsec-2. Red diamonds correspond to the light peaks associated with each mass component. The white cross shows the barycentre of the Einstein ring as estimated by Meneghetti et al. (2011) at \u03b1 = 109.38002,\u03b4 = 37.752214.

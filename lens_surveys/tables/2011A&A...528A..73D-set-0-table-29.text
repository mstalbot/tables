The white circles in the middle and right panels mark the centre of the predicted counter-images. The black circle in the left panel indicates a candidate counter-image of C.1, indentified with SExtractor. The three images are WCS-aligned; the flux scale of the second and the third panel is the same.","1":"In the text"}}

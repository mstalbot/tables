Black circles are the SPIRE data, while diamonds and triangle are the NIKA and VLA fluxes, respectively. The downward triangles indicate the non detection from PACS. The IR SED was fit using the IR libraries of Schreiber et al. (2018) (light blue) and Draine et al. (2014) (purple). The MS IR SED derived by Schreiber et al. (2017) from a sample of ALMA detected z\u2004=\u20044 sources is shown with the dashed orange line. A scaling of this MS SED to the 350 \u03bcm flux of RV4 leads to a scaling factor of 14.8.","1":"Open with DEXTER"}}

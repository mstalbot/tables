{"0":{"0":null},"1":{"0":"Fig. 3. 5\u03c3 continuum flux limit estimated in empty sky region of the MACS0940 datacube (8 h exposure time), including (orange curve) or not (blue curve) the correction for correlated noise. The increased noise level within the AO filter (around 5890 Angstroms) is due to the shorter effective exposure time in WFM-NOAO-N instrument mode (50 min)."}}

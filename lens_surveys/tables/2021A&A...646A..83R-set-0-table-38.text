We observe a significant drop in the number of sources at low magnifications (\u03bc\u2004< 1.5), due to the limits set by the FoV of the MUSE observations, and at very high magnifications (\u03bc\u2004> 25) due to the very small statistics and possibly the resolved nature of Lyman-\u03b1 emitters.","1":"In the text"}}

All the secure estimations are within the displayed range of errors of \u00b1 20 days. Only 2.6% of the time delays in the plausible sample have an absolute error larger than 20 days. Right panel: absolute time-delay error made by D3CS as a function of the true delay for both samples.","1":"Open with DEXTER","2":"In the text"}}

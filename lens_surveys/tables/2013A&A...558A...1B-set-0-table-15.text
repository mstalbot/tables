{"0":{"0":null},"1":{"0":"Fig. 13  Top panel: the projected mass profile  Mp(R) from the joint MAMPOSSt+Caustic  pNFW solution (solid yellow line) within 1\u03c3 confidence region  (hatched gray region), and from the lensing analysis of U12 (dashed white line: strong lensing analysis; dash-dotted  line: weak lensing analysis, after subtraction of the contribution of the  large-scale structure along the line-of-sight) within 1\u03c3 confidence  region (hatched magenta regions). The black triple-dots-dashed line is the pNFW mass  profile from U12\u2019s analysis of Chandra data.  The vertical dashed line indicates the location of  r200,U in both panels.  Bottom panel: the ratio between the kinematic and lensing  determinations of Mp(R). The white  dashed and dash-dotted (resp. solid yellow) line represents the ratio obtained using  the non parametric determination (resp. the pNFW parametrization) of the lensing  Mp(R). The pink hatched region  represents the confidence region of this ratio for the non parametric  Mp(R) lensing solution. The  horizontal black dotted line indicates the value of unity."}}

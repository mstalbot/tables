Bottom: deconvolution of the two images unveiling a ring-like structure and a narrow pair of bright point sources, labelled\u00a0A, that dominates the total flux in the blue. In contrast, the object in the center of the ring, i.e., the putative lensing object, is red. Two other objects are seen about the lens, labelled B and C. The 1.5\u2032\u2032 slit of the LRIS spectrograph is shown, and oriented with PA\u00a0= +\u00a060\u00b0.","1":"Open with DEXTER"}}

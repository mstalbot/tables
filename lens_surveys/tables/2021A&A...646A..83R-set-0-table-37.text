The red curves shows the best fit Gaussian model of the distribution (2 Gaussian components in Abell 2744). Right panel: comparison between the total velocity dispersion from the dPIE profiles in the mass model and the total velocity dispersion from the velocity distribution. The square symbols mark the three clusters with only partial MUSE coverage in the cluster cores.","1":"In the text"}}

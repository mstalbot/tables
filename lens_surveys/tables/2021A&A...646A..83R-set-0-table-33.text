Top row shows the case of the bright z\u2004=\u20044.03 galaxy in MACS0940 (Claeyssens et al. 2019) with zconf\u2004=\u20043 and the bottom row a MUSELET-selected galaxy at z\u2004=\u20040.337 and zconf\u2004=\u20042 in the same cluster field (M364). The left panel gives an overview of the spectrum, while the middle and right panels zoom in on specific spectral line fits. The best-fit spectrum and global continuum fit are plotted in red and blue, respectively.","1":"In the text"}}

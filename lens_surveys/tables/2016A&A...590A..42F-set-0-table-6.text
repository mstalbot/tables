We modeled the deflectors as SIS (\u27e8\u03c4SIS\u27e9-continuous black line) and SIE mass distributions (\u27e8\u03c4SIE\u27e9-continuous gray line). In the latter case, we also show the average optical depth with detection of two lensed images (\u27e8\u03c4SIE,2\u27e9 \u2013 dashed gray line). Right: fraction of lensed sources detected with three (light gray) or four (dark gray) lensed images as a function of \u03b8min. The results for the case of early- and late-type galaxy deflectors are shown with continuous and dash-dotted lines, respectively. In both panels we indicate the typical value of \u03b8min for the Gaia survey and typical seeing-limited ground-based observations.","1":"Open with DEXTER"}}

This corresponds to the NFW best-fit to the lensing mass profile  of U12 (white curve within magenta region)  out to r200,U (indicated by a vertical  dashed line), and to the Caustic non parametric mass profile (green curve within  light green region) beyond that radius. The dashed black curve represents the NFW  best-fit solution obtained by the combined MAMPOSSt+Caustic analysis.","1":"In the text"}}

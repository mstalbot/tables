{"0":{"0":null},"1":{"0":"Fig. 4  Top left: surface-mass-density profile for the smooth component of the cored (yellow) and the non-cored (green) mass model. The blue line shows the same quantity, as derived by Diego et al. (2015b). Shaded areas represent 3\u03c3 uncertainties. Top right: cumulative two-dimensional mass profile for the cored (yellow) and the non-cored (green) mass model (abscissa in arc seconds). Bottom: absolute value of the relative difference between each models. Blue contours mark where the difference is 20%, and cyan contours where it is 30%. The mass contours corresponding to the non-cored model are shown in green. The size of the field is 226\u2033\u2009\u00d7\u2009155\u2033."}}

We have included the LF determined by Richards et al. (2005) and Palanque-Delabrouille et al. (2013) (converted to Mi magnitude). The different fitted models correspond to no contraints on the redshift behavior of M\u2217 and \u03a6\u2217 (dashed light gray line), to an evolution model for \u03a6\u2217 and M\u2217 is fitted freely (light gray line), and to M\u2217 and \u03a6\u2217 both constrained by an evolution model (continuous black line). The latter is the final evolution model chosen for the simulations, see main text for the full description.","1":"Open with DEXTER","2":"In the text"}}

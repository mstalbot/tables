The fluxes from the R500R and R500B grism data are shown in bright and light green, respectively. We note that the spectral edges are particularly noisy and not included here. The red-shifted (z = 0.607) spectral template is drawn with magenta lines. Vertical dashed lines are associated with absorption features, while grey highlighted regions are related to atmospheric artefacts.","1":"Open with DEXTER","2":"In the text"}}

{"0":{"0":null},"1":{"0":"Fig. 6. Top row: cumulative projected total mass profile out to R\u2004=\u2004470 kpc from our reference lensing models using the PIEMD (blue) and gNFW (magenta) profiles for the main smooth mass component. Red and green regions show the models from Zitrin et al. (2015) with the two parametrizations NFW and LTM, respectively. Bottom row: same for the total surface mass density profile. The areas correspond to the 95% confidence level regions from 1000 random realizations of our models and 100 for the NFW and LTM models. Vertical lines indicate the distances from the BCG of the multiple images used to constraint the cluster total mass model in this work (black) and in Zitrin et al. (2015) (red, mainly with no spectroscopic measurements). The position of the centre used to compute the profiles in each realization is given by the centre of mass estimated within a circle of 10\u2033 radius from the BCG. We remark that the external smooth components of MACS J1931 and MACS J2129 do not affect the total mass distributions over the radial distances considered here."}}

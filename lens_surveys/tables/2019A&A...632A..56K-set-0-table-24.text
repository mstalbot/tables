Right panel: distribution of the W1\u2005\u2212\u2005W2 colour for the train samples. A fair agreement can be found between corresponding classes, although the distribution for the full catalogues is generally broader than that of the training samples. In both panels, the peak of the QSO distribution is shifted towards larger W1\u2005\u2212\u2005W2 with respect to the GALAXY and STARS, as expected.","1":"Open with DEXTER","2":"In the text"}}

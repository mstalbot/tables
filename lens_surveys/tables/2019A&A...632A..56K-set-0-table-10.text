The coloured areas represent the standard deviation of the mean \u03c3\/N, where \u03c3 is the standard deviation and N is the number of quasars in each bin. The black horizontal line in the right plot represents the parallax zero-point (equals to \u22120.029 mas, Lindegren et al. 2018).","1":"Open with DEXTER"}}

Lensing analysis of U12: small magenta-filled region (with white border) and white  filled dot. MAMPOSSt analysis: black vertically-elongated contour and filled square.  Caustic analysis: green inclined contour and green diamond. Joint MAMPOSSt + Caustic  constraints: gray-filled region and gray dot with yellow borders. Best-fit value and  1\u03c3 error bars from the  \u03c3los+r\u03bd  analysis: big red cross. The solid (resp. dashed) blue line and shaded cyan region  represent the theoretical cMr of Bhattacharya et al. (2013) for relaxed (resp. all) halos and its  1\u03c3 scatter. The dash-dotted blue line represents the theoretical  cMr of De Boni et al.  (2013) for relaxed halos.","1":"In the text"}}

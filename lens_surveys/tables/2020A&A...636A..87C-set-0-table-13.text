We further mask out nearby objects. Second column: model with a S\u00e9rsic light profile and four PSFs, and the residual is shown in the third column with the reduced . Fourth column: best-fit SIE model. The critical and caustic curves are shown in red solid and dashed lines, respectively. The predicted positions of images and sources are labeled as orange crosses and green diamonds, respectively. The positions of the four PSFs are labeled as white circles. To negate the effects of the nearby galaxy group, we impose external shear for HSCJ022622\u2212042522 to obtain better modeling. Each cutout is 7\u2033\u2005\u00d7\u20057\u2033.","1":"Open with DEXTER","2":"In the text"}}

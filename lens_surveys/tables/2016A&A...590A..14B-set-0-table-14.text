The footprint of the MUSE field is displayed together with the sources spectroscopically identified in this field: cluster galaxies (red), stars (magenta), background galaxies at z \u2264 3 (cyan), and z \u2265 3 (yellow). Cluster galaxies that were manually extracted are labeled CG. Objects labeled LN correspond to either line emitters or multiple images lacking a counterpart in the reference catalog based on the F775W image (see text for details). North is up, east is left. A tentative spectroscopic redshift was also obtained for the long southeast arcs in this field, namely 8a and 8b in C10 (see discussion in Sect. 4.1). At the redshift of the cluster, the MUSE field is equivalent to ~185 \u00d7 185 kpc.","1":"In the text"}}

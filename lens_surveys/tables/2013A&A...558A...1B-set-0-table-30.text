{"0":{"0":null,"1":"In the text"},"1":{"0":"Fig. 9  Results of the MAMPOSSt analysis using the NFW and O models for  M(r) and \u03b2(r),  respectively. The vertical lines and dots indicate the best-fit solutions. The  likelihood distributions on each parameter are obtained by marginalizing vs. the  other two parameters. Gray-shading in the likelihood distribution plots indicate the  1\u03c3 confidence regions. The red, gray-shaded contours are  1\u03c3 confidence levels on the two labeled parameters, obtained by  marginalizing vs. the third parameter. Note that we show results for  \u03c3r\/\u03c3\u03b8  rather than for \u03b2 (see Eq. (1)).","1":"In the text"}}

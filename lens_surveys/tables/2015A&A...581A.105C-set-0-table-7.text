The Dusty GEMS targets are shown as red stars on top of the comparison samples of strongly lensed sources taken from the literature (see Greve et al. 2012, and references therein), lens candidates from the SPT survey (Vieira et al. 2013), the Eyelash (Ivison et al. 2010b), and the two Planck lenses that were discovered prior to our work (Combes et al. 2012; Fu et al. 2012). The solid line shows a fit to the general population, while the dotted lines show magnification factors of 10 and 50. Bottom: FIR luminosity as a function of redshift. In the lower panel, our sources fall near the most luminous gravitationally lensed galaxies at similar redshifts; however, these are strongly dominated by AGN, like APM 08279+5255, whereas our sources are bona fide starbursts, at least in the image plane. This explains the greater luminosities at lower dust temperatures seen in the top panel.","1":"Open with DEXTER"}}

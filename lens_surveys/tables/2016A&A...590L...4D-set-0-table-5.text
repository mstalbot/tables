The dotted curve indicates the 1\u03c3 uncertainty of the spectrum. The most prominent absorption and emission lines, at a measured redshift of z = 2.369, are labelled on the figure and indicated with vertical dotted lines. Also plotted (orange curve) is a composite spectrum of ~1000 Lyman break galaxies at z ~ 3 from Shapley et al. (2003).","1":"Open with DEXTER"}}

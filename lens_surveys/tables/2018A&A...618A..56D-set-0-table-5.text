Results obtained from Gaia\u2019s data are presented in red and with HST data in grey. The diagonal panels illustrate the posterior PDFs while the off-axis panels illustrate the correlation between the parameters. The three inner contours represent the 68.3%, 95.4%, and 99.7% confidence intervals.","1":"Open with DEXTER"}}

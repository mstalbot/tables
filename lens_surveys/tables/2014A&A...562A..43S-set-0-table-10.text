Grey scale is a 10\u2032\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u2032 TGSS 150 MHz intensity map around PLCK G004.5\u221219.5, with contours in blue. Contours are shown at 3, 5, 7, and 15 times \u03c3, where \u03c3 is the background rms. Contours are shown in green for NVSS (1.4 GHz) and in red for SUMSS (843 MHz) data. Both contour sets are in units of 3, 5, 10, and 20 times each \u03c3. The orange cross shows the position of the BCG. The dashed black rectangle is the region shown in Fig. 1 and the black circle marks Mpc. The black bar in the bottom right corner marks a scale of 2\u2032. The SUMSS, NVSS, and TGSS beams are shown from left to right, respectively, in the bottom left corner (hatched ellipses).","1":"Open with DEXTER","2":"In the text"}}

References are given in the figure for different redshifts. Solid lines display the steepest slopes adopted for the LF fit: \u03b1 = \u22121.7 for Kashikawa et al. (2011) and Blanc et al. (2011), \u03b1 = \u22122.0 for Shioya et al. (2009), and \u03b1 = \u22121.6 for Dawson et al. (2007). Dashed and dotted lines correspond to \u03b1 = \u22121.5 and \u22121.3 for Kashikawa et al. (2011) and \u03b1 = \u22121.5 and \u22121.0 for Shioya et al. (2009). Error bars include Poisson noise statistics and field-to-field variance (see text).","1":"In the text"}}

Left panel shows the HST colour image and the right panel the MUSE NB image around the Lyman-\u03b1 emission. White dashed contours of the NB are overlayed on HST. The red curve shows the critical line at this redshift, which crosses the arc-shaped Lyman-\u03b1 emission at the location of a point-like source in HST."}}

Circles have  diameters of 0.60\u2032\u2032, which is close to the FWHM seeing measured  in the MUSE data. Cyan isocontours display flux levels for  Lyman-\u03b1 emission from 0.3 to 8 \u00d7 10-19  erg\/s\/cm2\/pix2, with bins of 1.25 \u00d7 10-20  erg\/s\/cm2\/pix2. The brightest source seen in the HST image  is likely to be a cluster galaxy, but no spectroscopic redshift could be  determined for it.","1":"In the text"}}

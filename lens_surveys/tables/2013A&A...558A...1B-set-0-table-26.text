This is the ratio of two adaptive-kernel number  density maps, one for all the objects with z, and the other for all  the photometric objects, both within the magnitude range  18\u00a0\u2264\u00a0mR\u00a0\u2264\u00a023. Contours are labeled  with the completeness levels, and show that the spectroscopic completeness becomes  slightly higher closer to the center.

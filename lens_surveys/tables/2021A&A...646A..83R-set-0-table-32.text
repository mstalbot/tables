Example of faint Lyman-\u03b1 emission (large yellow circle) detected near the position of the predicted counterimage from muselet source 641 in cluster MACS0329, at z\u2004=\u20046.011 (small white circle). The image shows a smoothed narrow-band image at the peak wavelength of the emission. The dotted ellipse denotes the estimated 1-\u03c3 error region of the predicted location.","1":"In the text"}}

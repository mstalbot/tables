The samples from the literature are: SL2S (More et al. 2012), SPT (Spilker et al. 2016), BELLS (Shu et al. 2016), MaNGA (Talbot et al. 2018), H-ATLAS (Amvrosiadis et al. 2018), and the sources of Li et al. (2018) and Ca\u00f1ameras et al. (2017). The position of HL1 is marked by the red star. Upper panel: Einstein radius in arcsecond as a function of the redshift of the lens. Different symbols are from different samples of the literature. Lower panel: same as above, but with the Einstein radius expressed in kiloparsec. The density contours are built from the same sample of literature sources.","1":"Open with DEXTER","2":"In the text"}}

The user-defined reference points in the reference image 1 are marked by red circles, while the red-encircled regions in the remaining images denote 95% confidence bounds of the locations of the transformed reference points by the best-fit linear transformations. (Image credits: NASA, ESA, M. J. Jee (Johns Hopkins University)). Also shown is a diagram of the principle of extracting local lens properties from the linear transformation between multiple images from the same source (right).","1":"In the text"}}

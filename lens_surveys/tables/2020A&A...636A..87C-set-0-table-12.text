The stacked 1D spectrum of the X-shooter lensed source and its counterpart are shown with red and blue lines, respectively, in the lower panel, with corresponding emission lines marked by the vertical dashed lines and labeled above the panels. The errors on the spectrum are shown with a shaded region (gray). The black lines show Gaussian fits to the emission lines. The vertical shaded region (cyan) shown in all panels indicates absorption features due to telluric contamination. The semi-transparent panels show the locations of common emission lines that are not detected for the given source redshift. The unit of wavelength is angstroms.","1":"Open with DEXTER","2":"In the text"}}

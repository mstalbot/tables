AGN types simulated are type 1 (blue), intermediate type (green), and type 2 (red), as defined in Ciesla et al. (2015). The different lines correspond to different power of the AGN from 0% (no AGN) to 50% of the total IR luminosity. The gray downward triangles are the WISE 12 and 22 \u03bcm upper limits while the black downward triangles are the Herschel\/PACS upper limits.","1":"Open with DEXTER"}}

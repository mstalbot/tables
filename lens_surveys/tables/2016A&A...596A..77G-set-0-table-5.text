Instead of \u03bb values, the x-axis displays the wavelength-dependent quantity x \u221d 1 \/\u03bb (see main text). Assuming microlensing-free fluxes of line cores and Galactic extinction in the lensing galaxy, we also show the best fits using Mg\u2009ii + C\u2009iii] + C\u2009iv data (dotted red line), Mg\u2009ii + C\u2009iii] + C\u2009iv + Si\u2009iv\/O\u2009iv] data (dashed red line) and the five measurements (solid red line). For a standard linear extinction in the lensing galaxy, the solid green line traces the best fit to the five magnitude differences.","1":"Open with DEXTER"}}

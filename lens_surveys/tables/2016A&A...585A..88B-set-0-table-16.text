The plots are sorted by increasing values of the blind precision (see text). Shaded regions represent the error on the metrics. Solid grey lines show the target values for the metrics as defined in the TDC1 paper. Dashed grey lines show the best possible value for each metric. The bottom row presents the non-cumulative evolution of the median of the true time delays | \u0394ti | in bins of ten estimations.","1":"Open with DEXTER","2":"In the text"}}

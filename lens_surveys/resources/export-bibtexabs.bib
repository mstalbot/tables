     abstract = "{Strong gravitational lenses are a rare and instructive type of
        astronomical object. Identification has long relied on
        serendipity, but different strategies{\textemdash}such as mixed
        spectroscopy of multiple galaxies along the line of sight,
        machine-learning algorithms, and citizen
        science{\textemdash}have been employed to identify these objects
        as new imaging surveys become available. We report on the
        comparison between spectroscopic, machine-learning, and citizen-
        science identification of galaxy-galaxy lens candidates from
        independently constructed lens catalogs in the common survey
        area of the equatorial fields of the Galaxy and Mass Assembly
        survey. In these, we have the opportunity to compare high
        completeness spectroscopic identifications against high-fidelity
        imaging from the Kilo Degree Survey used for both machine-
        learning and citizen-science lens searches. We find that the
        three methods{\textemdash}spectroscopy, machine learning, and
        citizen science{\textemdash}identify 47, 47, and 13 candidates,
        respectively, in the 180 square degrees surveyed. These
        identifications barely overlap, with only two identified by both
        citizen science and machine learning. We have traced this
        discrepancy to inherent differences in the selection functions
        of each of the three methods, either within their parent samples
        (i.e., citizen science focuses on low redshift) or inherent to
        the method (i.e., machine learning is limited by its training
        sample and prefers well-separated features, while spectroscopy
        requires sufficient flux from lensed features to lie within the
        fiber). These differences manifest as separate samples in
        estimated Einstein radius, lens stellar mass, and lens redshift.
        The combined sample implies a lens candidate sky density of
        {\ensuremath{\sim}}0.59 deg$^{-2}$ and can inform the
        construction of a training set spanning a wider mass-redshift
        space. A combined approach and refinement of automated searches
        would result in a more complete sample of galaxy-galaxy lens
        candidates for future surveys.}",

     abstract = "{Context. Strong lenses are extremely useful probes of the distribution
        of matter on galaxy and cluster scales at cosmological
        distances, however, they are rare and difficult to find. The
        number of currently known lenses is on the order of 1000.
        \textbackslash Aims: The aim of this study is to use
        crowdsourcing to carry out a lens search targeting massive
        galaxies selected from over 442 square degrees of photometric
        data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey. \textbackslash
        Methods: Based on the S16A internal data release of the HSC
        survey, we chose a sample of {\ensuremath{\sim}}300 000 galaxies
        with photometric redshifts in the range of 0.2 $\lt$ z$_{phot}$
        $\lt$ 1.2 and photometrically inferred stellar masses of log
        M$_{*}$ $\gt$ 11.2. We crowdsourced lens finding on this sample
        of galaxies on the Zooniverse platform as part of the Space
        Warps project. The sample was complemented by a large set of
        simulated lenses and visually selected non-lenses for training
        purposes. Nearly 6000 citizen volunteers participated in the
        experiment. In parallel, we used YATTALENS, an automated lens-
        finding algorithm, to look for lenses in the same sample of
        galaxies. \textbackslash Results: Based on a statistical
        analysis of classification data from the volunteers, we selected
        a sample of the most promising {\ensuremath{\sim}}1500
        candidates, which we then visually inspected: half of them
        turned out to be possible (grade C) lenses or better. By
        including lenses found by YATTALENS or serendipitously noticed
        in the discussion section of the Space Warps website, we were
        able to find 14 definite lenses (grade A), 129 probable lenses
        (grade B), and 581 possible lenses. YATTALENS found half the
        number of lenses that were discovered via crowdsourcing.
        \textbackslash Conclusions: Crowdsourcing is able to produce
        samples of lens candidates with high completeness, when multiple
        images are clearly detected, and with higher purity compared to
        the currently available automated algorithms. A hybrid approach,
        in which the visual inspection of samples of lens candidates
        pre-selected by discovery algorithms or coupled to machine
        learning is crowdsourced, will be a viable option for lens
        finding in the 2020s, with forthcoming wide-area surveys such as
        LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST. \textbackslash\textbackslashFull list

     abstract = "{We present a lensed quasar search based on the time variability of lens
        systems in the HSC transient survey. Starting from 101,353
        variable objects with $\textit{i}$-band difference images in the
        HSC transient survey, we use a time-variability-based lens
        search method measuring the spatial extendedness in difference
        images to select potential lensed quasar candidates. We adopt
        conservative constraints in this variability selection and
        obtain 83,657 variable objects as possible lens candidates. We
        then run CHITAH, a lens search algorithm based on the image
        configuration, on those 83,657 variable objects, and 2,130
        variable objects are identified as lensed objects. We visually
        inspect the 2,130 variable objects, and seven of them are our
        final candidates of lensed quasars. Additionally, we find one
        lensed galaxy candidate as a serendipitous discovery. Among the
        eight final lensed candidates, one is the only known quadruply
        lensed quasar in the survey field, HSCJ095921+020638. None of
        the other seven lensed candidates has been previously classified
        as a lens nor a lensed candidate. Three of the five final
        candidates with available Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images,
        including HSCJ095921+020638, show clues of lensed feature in the
        HST images. A tightening of variability selection criteria might
        result in the loss of possible lensed quasar candidates,
        especially the lensed quasars with faint brightness or narrow
        separation, without efficiently eliminating the non-lensed
        objects; CHITAH is therefore important as an advanced
        examination to improve the lens search efficiency through the
        object configuration. The recovery of HSCJ095921+020638 proves
        the feasibility of the time-variability-based lens search
        method, and this lens search method can be used in other
        cadenced imaging surveys, such as the upcoming Rubin Observatory
        Legacy Survey of Space and Time.}",

        1.2 m Swiss Telescope. The decade-long light curves of 23 lensed
        systems are presented for the first time. We complement our data
        set with other monitoring data available in the literature to
        measure the time delays in 18 systems, among which nine reach a
        relative precision better than 15\% for at least one time delay.
        To achieve this, we developed an automated version of the curve-
        shifting toolbox PyCS to ensure robust estimation of the time
        delay in the presence of microlensing, while accounting for the
        errors due to the imperfect representation of microlensing. We
        also re-analysed the previously published time delays of RX
        J1131-1231 and HE 0435-1223, by adding six and two new seasons
        of monitoring, respectively, and confirming the previous time-

        we corrected the light curves of the lensed images from their

        with an Einstein radius {\ensuremath{\theta}}$_{Ein}$ = 2.0

        function (IMF). At present, only a few such systems are known.
        Here, we report the first results from a blind search for
        gravitationally lensed emission-line sources behind 52 massive z
        $\lt$ 0.07 ETGs with Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE)
        integral field spectroscopy. For 16 galaxies, new observations
        were acquired, whilst the other 36 were analysed from archival
        data. This project has previously yielded one confirmed galaxy-
        scale strong lens (J0403-0239) that we report in an earlier
        paper. J0403-0239 has since received follow-up observations,
        presented here, which indicate support for our earlier IMF

        lensing systems were also discovered (central galaxies of A4059,
        A2052, and AS555). For nine further galaxies, we detect a singly

        one candidate with sources at three different redshifts); such

        scatter), which is inconsistent with a Salpeter-like IMF
        ({\ensuremath{\alpha}} = 1.55) at the 6{\ensuremath{\sigma}}

        yield a new strong-lens system. Our observational results are

        {\ensuremath{\sim}} 120 mJy in the line of sight of the Virgo
        cluster which we name Red Virgo 4 (RV4). Based on IRAM/EMIR and
        IRAM/NOEMA detections of the CO(5-4), CO(4-3), and [CI] lines,
        RV4 is located at a redshift of 4.724, yielding a total observed
        infrared luminosity of 1.1 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.6 {\texttimes}
        {}10$^{14}$ L$_{☉}$. At the position of the Herschel emission,
        three blobs are detected with the VLA at 10 cm. The CO(5-4) line
        detection of each blob confirms that they are at the same
        redshift with the same line width, indicating that they are
        multiple images of the same source. In Spitzer and deep optical
        observations, two sources, High-z Lens 1 (HL1) West and HL1
        East, are detected at the center of the three VLA/NOEMA blobs.
        These two sources are placed at z = 1.48 with X-shooter spectra,
        suggesting that they could be merging and gravitationally
        lensing the emission of RV4. HL1 is the second most distant lens
        known to date in strong lensing systems. Constrained by the
        position of the three VLA/NOEMA blobs, the Einstein radius of
        the lensing system is 2.2″ {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.2 (20 kpc). The
        high redshift of HL1 and the large Einstein radius are highly
        unusual for a strong lensing system. In this paper, we present
        the insterstellar medium properties of the background source
        RV4. Different estimates of the gas depletion time yield low
        values suggesting that RV4 is a starburst galaxy. Among all
        high-z submillimeter galaxies, this source exhibits one of the
        lowest L$_{[CI]}$ to L$_{IR}$ ratios, 3.2 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.9
        {\texttimes} 10$^{-6}$, suggesting an extremely short gas
        depletion time of only 14 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 5 Myr. It also
        shows a relatively high L$_{[CI]}$ to L$_{CO(4-3)}$ ratio (0.7
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.2) and low L$_{CO(5-4)}$ to L$_{IR}$ ratio
        (only {\ensuremath{\sim}}50\% of the value expected for normal
        galaxies) hinting at low density of gas. Finally, we discuss the
        short depletion time of RV4. It can be explained by either a
        very high star formation efficiency, which is difficult to
        reconcile with major mergers simulations of high-z galaxies, or
        a rapid decrease of star formation, which would bias the
        estimate of the depletion time toward an artificially low value.}",

        the pair does not arise from a single gravitationally lensed

        sight central velocity dispersion of the deflector, and
        statistically constrained external convergence with our lens
        models to estimate two cosmological distances. We measure the

        previous sample of six lenses analysed by the H$_{0}$ Lenses in

     abstract = "{We report the results of the STRong lensing Insights into the Dark
        Energy Survey (STRIDES) follow-up campaign of the late
        2017/early 2018 season. We obtained spectra of 65 lensed quasar
        candidates with ESO Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera 2 on
        the NTT and Echellette Spectrograph and Imager on Keck,
        confirming 10 new lensed quasars and 10 quasar pairs. Eight
        lensed quasars are doubly imaged with source redshifts between
        0.99 and 2.90, one is triply imaged (DESJ0345-2545, z = 1.68),
        and one is quadruply imaged (quad: DESJ0053-2012, z = 3.8).
        Singular isothermal ellipsoid models for the doubles, based on
        high-resolution imaging from SAMI on Southern Astrophysical
        Research Telescope or Near InfraRed Camera 2 on Keck, give total
        magnifications between 3.2 and 5.6, and Einstein radii between
        0.49 and 1.97 arcsec. After spectroscopic follow-up, we extract
        multi-epoch grizY photometry of confirmed lensed quasars and
        contaminant quasar + star pairs from DES data using parametric
        multiband modelling, and compare variability in each system's
        components. By measuring the reduced {\ensuremath{\chi}}$^{2}$
        associated with fitting all epochs to the same magnitude, we
        find a simple cut on the less variable component that retains
        all confirmed lensed quasars, while removing 94 per cent of
        contaminant systems. Based on our spectroscopic follow-up, this
        variability information improves selection of lensed quasars and
        quasar pairs from 34-45 per cent to 51-70 per cent, with most
        remaining contaminants being star-forming galaxies. Using mock
        lensed quasar light curves we demonstrate that selection based
        only on variability will over-represent the quad fraction by 10
        per cent over a complete DES magnitude-limited sample, explained
        by the magnification bias and hence lower luminosity/more
        variable sources in quads.}",

     abstract = "{Context. The KiDS Strongly lensed QUAsar Detection project (KiDS-SQuaD)
        is aimed at finding as many previously undiscovered
        gravitational lensed quasars as possible in the Kilo Degree
        Survey. This is the second paper of this series where we present
        a new, automatic object-classification method based on the
        machine learning technique. \textbackslash Aims: The main goal
        of this paper is to build a catalogue of bright extragalactic
        objects (galaxies and quasars) from the KiDS Data Release 4,
        with minimum stellar contamination and preserving the
        completeness as much as possible. We show here that this
        catalogue represents the perfect starting point to search for
        reliable gravitationally lensed quasar candidates.
        \textbackslash Methods: After testing some of the most used
        machine learning algorithms, decision-tree-based classifiers, we
        decided to use CatBoost, which was specifically trained with the
        aim of creating a sample of extragalactic sources that is as
        clean of stars as possible. We discuss the input data, define
        the training sample for the classifier, give quantitative
        estimates of its performances, and finally describe the
        validation results with Gaia DR2, AllWISE, and GAMA catalogues.
        \textbackslash Results: We built and made available to the
        scientific community the KiDS Bright EXtraGalactic Objects
        catalogue (KiDS-BEXGO), specifically created to find
        gravitational lenses but applicable to a wide number of
        scientific purposes. The KiDS-BEXGO catalogue is made of
        {\ensuremath{\approx}}6 million sources classified as quasars
        ({\ensuremath{\approx}}200 000) and galaxies
        ({\ensuremath{\approx}}5.7 M) up to r $\lt$ 22$^{m}$. To
        demonstrate the potential of the catalogue in the search for
        strongly lensed quasars, we selected {\ensuremath{\approx}}950
        ``Multiplets'': close pairs of quasars or galaxies surrounded by
        at least one quasar. We present cutouts and coordinates of the
        12 most reliable gravitationally lensed quasar candidates. We
        showed that employing a machine learning method decreases the
        stellar contaminants within the gravitationally lensed
        candidates, comparing the current results to the previous ones,
        presented in the first paper from this series. \textbackslash
        Conclusions: Our work presents the first comprehensive
        identification of bright extragalactic objects in KiDS DR4 data,
        which is, for us, the first necessary step towards finding
        strong gravitational lenses in wide-sky photometric surveys, but
        has also many other more general astrophysical applications.

        consists of four images ABCD of a background quasar around a

        use long-slit spectroscopic data in the Gemini Observatory

        However, these objects are rare and challenging to discover due
        to requirements of high-angular resolution astrometric,
        multiwavelength photometric and spectroscopic data. This has
        limited the number of known systems to a few hundred objects. We
        aim to reduce the constraints on angular resolution and discover
        multiply-imaged QSO candidates by using new candidate selection
        principles based on unresolved photometric time-series and
        ground-based images from public surveys. We selected candidates
        for multiply-imaged QSOs based on low levels of entropy computed
        from Catalina unresolved photometric time-series or Euclidean
        similarity to known lenses in a space defined by the wavelet
        power spectra of Pan-STARSS DR2 or DECaLS DR7 images, combined

        with Hubble and the Frontier Fields, have demonstrated the power
        of strong gravitational lensing to efficiently deliver large
        samples of high-redshift galaxies. We extend this strategy
        through a wider, shallower survey named RELICS, the Reionization
        Lensing Cluster Survey, described here. Our 188-orbit Hubble
        Treasury Program observed 41 clusters at 0.182

        Camera for Surveys (ACS) and WFC3/IR imaging spanning 0.4-1.7
        {\ensuremath{\mu}}m. We selected 21 of the most massive clusters
        known based on Planck PSZ2 estimates and 20 additional clusters
        based on observed or inferred lensing strength. RELICS observed
        46 WFC3/IR pointings ({\ensuremath{\sim}}200 arcmin$^{2}$) each
        with two orbits divided among four filters (F105W, F125W, F140W,
        and F160W) and ACS imaging as needed to achieve single-orbit
        depth in each of three filters (F435W, F606W, and F814W). As
        previously reported by Salmon et al., we discovered over 300 z
        {\ensuremath{\sim}} 6-10 candidates, including the brightest z
        {\ensuremath{\sim}} 6 candidates known, and the most distant
        spatially resolved lensed arc known at z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 10.
        Spitzer IRAC imaging (945 hr awarded, plus 100 archival,
        spanning 3.0-5.0 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m) has crucially enabled us
        to distinguish z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 10 candidates from z
        {\ensuremath{\sim}} 2 interlopers. For each cluster, two HST
        observing epochs were staggered by about a month, enabling us to
        discover 11 supernovae, including 3 lensed supernovae, which we
        followed up with 20 orbits from our program. Reduced HST images,
        catalogs, and lens models are available on MAST, and reduced
        Spitzer images are available on IRSA.}",

        (GL) to be discovered from a machine learning technique that
        only relies on the relative positions and fluxes of the observed
        images without considering colour informations. Follow-up
        spectra obtained with Keck/LRIS reveal the lensing nature of
        this quadruply imaged quasar with redshift z$_{s}$ = 1.090
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.002, but show no evidence of the central
        lens galaxy. Using the image positions and G-band flux ratios
        provided by Gaia Data Release 2 as constraints, we modeled the
        system with a singular power-law elliptical mass distribution
        (SPEMD) plus external shear, to different levels of complexity.
        We show that relaxing the isothermal constraint of the SPEMD
        does not lead to statistically significant different results in
        terms of fitting the lensing data. We thus simplified the SPEMD
        to a singular isothermal ellipsoid to estimate the Einstein
        radius of the main lens galaxy {\ensuremath{\theta}}$_{E}$ =
        0.″851, the intensity and position angle of the external shear (
        {\ensuremath{\gamma}},{\ensuremath{\theta}}$_{{\ensuremath{\gamm
        a}}}$) = (0.044, 11.{\textdegree}5), and we predict the lensing
        galaxy position to be ({\ensuremath{\theta}}$_{gal,1}$,
        {\ensuremath{\theta}}$_{gal,2}$) = (-0.″424, -0.″744) with
        respect to image A. We provide time delay predictions for pairs
        of images, assuming a plausible range of lens redshift values
        z$_{l}$ between 0.5 and 0.9. Finally, we examine the impact on
        time delays of the so-called source position transformation, a
        family of degeneracies existing between different mass density
        profiles that reproduce most of the lensing observables equally
        well. We show that this effect contributes significantly to the
        time delay error budget and cannot be ignored during the
        modeling. This has implications for robust cosmography
        applications of lensed systems. GRAL 113100-441959 is the first
        in a series of seven new spectroscopically confirmed GLs

        performances of these two observational strategies, we calculate
        expected discovery rates as a function of survey depth in five
        grizy filters and for different classes of SNe (types Ia, IIP,
        IIL, Ibc, and IIn). We find that detections via magnification is
        the only effective strategy for relatively shallow pre-LSST
        (Large Synoptic Sky Survey) surveys. For survey depths about the
        LSST capacity, both strategies yield comparable numbers of
        lensed SNe. SN samples from the two methods are to a large
        extent independent and combining them increases detection rates
        by about 50 per cent. While the number of lensed SNe detectable
        via magnification saturates at the limiting magnitudes of LSST,
        detection rates of multiply imaged SN still go up drastically at
        increasing survey depth. Comparing potential discovery spaces,
        we find that lensed SNe found via image multiplicity exhibit
        longer time delays and larger image separations making them more
        suitable for cosmological constraints than their counterparts
        found via magnification. We provide useful fitting functions
        approximating the computed discovery rates for different SN
        classes and detection methods. We find that the Zwicky Transient
        Factory will find about two type Ia and four core-collapse
        lensed SNe per year at a limiting magnitude of 20.6 in the r
        band. Applying a hybrid method which combines searching for
        highly magnified or multiply imaged transients, we find that
        LSST will detect 89 type Ia and 254 core-collapse lensed SNe per
        year. In all cases, lensed core-collapsed SNe will be dominated
        by type IIn SNe contributing to 80 per cent of the total counts,
        although this prediction relies quite strongly on the adopted
        spectral templates for this class of SNe. Revisiting the case of
        the lensed SN iPTF16geu, we find that it is consistent within
        the 2{\ensuremath{\sigma}} contours of predicted redshifts and
        magnifications for the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory

        HATLAS J142935.3-002836 (also known as H1429-0028; z$_{lens}$ =
        0.218, z$_{bkg}$ = 1.027) is revisited following recent

        line profiles comprise three distinct velocity components, where
        the fainter high velocity one is less magnified and more
        compact. The modelling of the observed spectral line energy

        powerful cosmological tools. Only few dozen are known in the
        whole sky. Here we present the spectroscopic confirmation of two
        new quadruplets WG0214-2105 and WG2100-4452 discovered by
        Agnello \& Spiniello (2018) within the Dark Energy Survey public
        footprints. We have conducted spectroscopic follow-up of these
        systems with the Southern African Large Telescope as part of a
        program that aims at confirming the largest possible number of
        strong gravitational lenses in the equatorial and Southern
        hemisphere. For both systems, we present the sources spectra
        that allowed us to estimate their redshifts and unambiguously
        confirm their lensing nature. For the brighter deflector
        (WG2100-4452) we measure the spectroscopic redshift and the
        stellar velocity dispersion from optical absorption lines in the
        spectrum. For the other system we infer the lens redshift from
        photometry, being the quality of the spectra not good enough. We
        obtain photometry for both lenses, directly from multiband
        images, isolating the lenses from the quasars. One of the
        quadruplets, WG0214-2105, was also observed by Pan-STARRS,
        allowing us to estimate the apparent brightness of each quasar
        image at two different epochs, and thus to find evidence for
        flux variability. This result could suggest a microlensing event
        for the faintest components, although intrinsic variability
        cannot be excluded with only two epochs. Finally, we present
        simple lens models for both quadruplets, obtaining Einstein
        radii, singular isothermal ellipsoid velocity dispersions,
        ellipticities, and position angles of the lenses, as well as
        time-delay predictions assuming a concordance cosmological
        model.}",

        following LIGO-Virgo's discovery of the binary black hole (BH-
        BH) gravitational wave (GW) source GW170814. Our objectives were
        (1) to search for candidate electromagnetic (EM) counterparts to
        GW170814 under the hypothesis that it was strongly lensed, and
        thus more distant and less massive than inferred by LIGO-Virgo,
        and (2) to demonstrate the feasibility of rapid target of
        opportunity observations to search for faint lensed transient
        point sources in crowded cluster cores located within GW sky
        localizations. Commencing 20 h after discovery, and continuing
        over 12 nights, we observed Abell 3084 (z = 0.22) and SMACS
        J0304.3 - 4401 (z = 0.46) with GMOS on the Gemini-South
        telescope, and Abell 3084 with MUSE on ESO's Very Large
        Telescope. We detect no candidate EM counterparts in these data.
        Calibration of our photometric analysis methods using
        simulations yields 5{\ensuremath{\sigma}} detection limits for
        transients in difference images of the cores of these clusters
        of i = 25. This is the most sensitive photometric search to date
        for counterparts to GW sources, and rules out the possibility
        that GW170814 was lensed by these clusters with a kilonova-like
        EM counterpart. Based on the detector frame masses of the
        compact objects, and assuming that at least one neutron star
        (NS) is required in the merging system to produce a kilonova-
        like counterpart, implies that GW170814 was neither an NS-NS nor
        NS-BH merger at z $\gt$ 8 lensed by either of these clusters.
        Also, in the first ever emission line search for counterparts to
        GW sources, we detected no lines down to a
        5{\ensuremath{\sigma}} detection limit of 5{\texttimes}

        Type Ia SN resolved into multiple images, SN iPTF16geu. Fitting
        the multiple light curves of such objects can deliver
        measurements of the lensing time delays, which are the
        difference in arrival times for the separate images. These
        measurements provide precise tests of lens models or constraints
        on the Hubble constant and other cosmological parameters that
        are independent of the local distance ladder. Over the next
        decade, accurate time delay measurements will be needed for the
        tens to hundreds of lensed SNe to be found by wide-field time-
        domain surveys such as LSST and WFIRST. We have developed an
        open-source software package for simulations and time delay
        measurements of multiply imaged SNe, including an improved
        characterization of the uncertainty caused by microlensing.
        Using this package, we describe simulations that suggest that a
        before-peak detection of the leading image enables a more
        accurate and precise time delay measurement (by
        {\ensuremath{\sim}}1 and {\ensuremath{\sim}}2 days,
        respectively), when compared to an after-peak detection. We also
        conclude that fitting the effects of microlensing without an
        accurate prior often leads to biases in the time delay
        measurement and over-fitting to the data, but that employing a
        Gaussian Process Regression technique is sufficient for
        determining the uncertainty due to microlensing.}",

     abstract = "{We report the discovery and spectroscopic confirmation of 22 new
        gravitationally lensed quasars found using Gaia data release 2.
        The selection was made using several techniques: multiple Gaia
        detections around objects in quasar candidate catalogues,
        modelling of unWISE coadd pixels using Gaia astrometry, and Gaia
        detections offset from photometric and spectroscopic galaxies.
        Spectra of 33 candidates were obtained with the William Herschel
        Telescope, 22 of which are lensed quasars, two highly probably
        lensed quasars, five nearly identical quasar pairs, one
        inconclusive system, and three contaminants. Of the three
        confirmed quadruply imaged systems, J2145+6345 is a 2.1 arcsec
        separation quad with four bright images (G = 16.86, 17.26,
        18.34, 18.56), making it ideal for time delay monitoring.
        Analysing this new sample alongside known lenses in the Pan-
        STARRS footprint, and comparing to expected numbers of lenses,
        we show that, as expected, we are biased towards systems with
        bright lensing galaxies and low source redshifts. We discuss
        possible techniques to remove this bias from future searches. A
        |b| $\gt$ 20 complete sample of lensed quasars detected by Gaia
        and with image separations above 1 arcsec will provide a
        valuable statistical sample of around 350 systems. Currently
        only 96 known lenses satisfy these criteria, yet promisingly,
        our unWISE modelling technique is able to recover all of these
        with simple WISE-Gaia colour cuts that remove
        {\ensuremath{\sim}}80 per cent of previously followed-up
        contaminants. Finally, we provide an online data base of known
        lenses, quasar pairs, and contaminant systems.}",

        are unique probes to address several fundamental problems in
        cosmology and astrophysics. Although they are intrinsically very
        rare, ongoing and planned wide-field deep-sky surveys are set to
        discover thousands of such systems in the next decade. It is
        thus paramount to devise a general framework to model strong-
        lens systems to cope with this large influx without being
        limited by expert investigator time. We propose such a general
        modelling framework (implemented with the publicly available
        software LENSTRONOMY) and apply it to uniformly model three-band
        Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 images of 13 quads.
        This is the largest uniformly modelled sample of quads to date
        and paves the way for a variety of studies. To illustrate the
        scientific content of the sample, we investigate the alignment
        between the mass and light distribution in the deflectors. The
        position angles of these distributions are well-aligned, except
        when there is strong external shear. However, we find no
        correlation between the ellipticity of the light and mass
        distributions. We also show that the observed flux-ratios
        between the images depart significantly from the predictions of
        simple smooth models. The departures are strongest in the bluest
        band, consistent with microlensing being the dominant cause in
        addition to millilensing. Future papers will exploit this rich
        data set in combination with ground-based spectroscopy and time
        delays to determine quantities such as the Hubble constant, the
        free streaming length of dark matter, and the normalization of
        the initial stellar mass function.}",

        gravitational lens candidates based on a search performed over
        the entire Gaia Data Release 2 (Gaia DR2). We also aim to show
        that the astrometric and photometric information coming from the
        Gaia satellite yield sufficient insights for supervised learning
        methods to automatically identify strong gravitational lens
        candidates with an efficiency that is comparable to methods
        based on image processing. \textbackslash Methods: We simulated
        106 623 188 lens systems composed of more than two images, based
        on a regular grid of parameters characterizing a non-singular
        isothermal ellipsoid lens model in the presence of an external
        shear. These simulations are used as an input for training and
        testing our supervised learning models consisting of extremely
        randomized trees (ERTs). These trees are finally used to assign
        to each of the 2 129 659 clusters of celestial objects extracted
        from the Gaia DR2 a discriminant value that reflects the ability
        of our simulations to match the observed relative positions and
        fluxes from each cluster. Once complemented with additional
        constraints, these discriminant values allow us to identify
        strong gravitational lens candidates out of the list of
        clusters. \textbackslash Results: We report the discovery of 15
        new quadruply-imaged lens candidates with angular separations of
        less than 6″ and assess the performance of our approach by
        recovering 12 of the 13 known quadruply-imaged systems with all
        their components detected in Gaia DR2 with a misclassification
        rate of fortuitous clusters of stars as lens systems that is
        below 1\%. Similarly, the identification capability of our
        method regarding quadruply-imaged systems where three images are
        detected in Gaia DR2 is assessed by recovering 10 of the 13
        known quadruply-imaged systems having one of their constituting
        images discarded. The associated misclassification rate varies
        between 5.83\% and 20\%, depending on the image we decided to
        remove. \textbackslash\textbackslashThe catalogue of clusters of

        detected by the mJIVE-20 observations and re-mapped them to make

        rely of our ability to discover strongly lensed SNe with
        measurable time delays. Here, we present the magnifications and
        the time delays for the multiply-imaged galaxies behind the
        Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) galaxy clusters, by using recently
        published lensing models. Continuing on our previous work done
        for Abell 1689 (A1689) and Abell 370, we also show the prospects
        of observing strongly lensed SNe behind the HFF clusters with
        the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). With four 1-hour
        visits in one year, the summed expectations of all six HFF
        clusters are 0.5 core-collapse (CC) SNe and 0.06 Type Ia SNe
        (SNe Ia) in F115W band, while with F150W the expectations are
        higher, 0.9 CC SNe and 0.06 SNe Ia. These estimates match those
        expected by only surveying A1689, proving that the performance
        of A1689 as gravitational telescope is superior. In the five HFF
        clusters presented here, we find that F150W will be able to
        detect SNe Ia (SNe IIP) exploding in 93 (80) pairsmultiply-

        quasars in the imaging data of the Dark Energy Survey and
        following them up to measure time delays, high resolution
        imaging, and spectroscopy sufficient to construct accurate lens

        Then, we describe the STRIDES classification scheme, and give an
        overview of the Fall 2016 follow-up campaign. We continue by
        detailing the results of two selection methods, the outlier
        selection technique and a morphological algorithm, and
        presenting lens models of a system that could possibly be a
        lensed quasar in an unusual configuration. We conclude with the
        summary statistics of the Fall 2016 campaign. Including searches
        presented in companion papers (Anguita et al.; Ostrovski et
        al.), STRIDES followed up 117 targets identifying 7 new strongly
        lensed systems, and 7 nearly identical quasars, which could be
        confirmed as lenses by the detection of the lens galaxy. 76
        candidates were rejected and 27 remain otherwise inconclusive,
        for a success rate in the range of 6-35 per cent. This rate is

        confirmed to lie at z $\gt$ 5 (refs $^{6-10}$) and only two at z
        {\ensuremath{\geq}} 6 (refs $^{11,12}$). All of these
        submillimetre galaxies are rare examples of extreme starburst
        galaxies with star formation rates of

        offers a unique opportunity to discover new multiply imaged
        quasars and to study the already known lensed systems at sub-
        milliarcsecond astrometric precisions. \textbackslash Aims: In
        this paper, we address the detection of the known multiply
        imaged quasars from the Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) and determine
        the astrometric and photometric properties of the individually
        detected images found in the Gaia DR2 catalogue. \textbackslash
        Methods: We have compiled an exhaustive list of quasar
        gravitational lenses from the literature to search for
        counterparts in the Gaia DR2. We then analysed the astrometric
        and photometric properties of these Gaia's detections. To
        highlight the tremendous potential of Gaia at the sub-
        milliarcsecond level we finally performed a simple Bayesian
        modelling of the well-known gravitational lens system
        HE0435-1223, using Gaia DR2 and HST astrometry. \textbackslash
        Results: From 481 known multiply imaged quasars, 206 have at
        least one image found in the Gaia DR2. Among the 44 known
        quadruply imaged quasars of the list, 29 have at least one image
        in the Gaia DR2, 12 of which are fully detected (2MASX

        eight have three counterparts, eight have two and one has only
        one. As expected, the modelling of HE0435-1223 shows that the
        model parameters are significantly better constrained when using
        Gaia astrometry compared to HST astrometry, in particular the
        relative positions of the background quasar source and the
        centroid of the deflector. The Gaia sub-milliarcsecond
        astrometry also significantly reduces the parameter
        correlations. \textbackslash Conclusions: Besides providing an
        up-to-date list of multiply imaged quasars and their detection
        in the Gaia DR2, this paper shows that more complex modelling
        scenarios will certainly benefit from Gaia sub-milliarcsecond

        wavelength-dependent microlensing, which we use to place
        constraints on the sizes and temperature profiles of the
        accretion discs in each quasar. Accretion disc radius is assumed
        to vary with wavelength according to the power-law relationship
        r {\ensuremath{\propto}} {\ensuremath{\lambda}}$^{p}$,
        equivalent to a radial temperature profile of T
        {\ensuremath{\propto}} r$^{-1/p}$. The goal of this work is to
        search for deviations from standard thin disc theory, which
        predicts that radius goes as wavelength to the power p = 4/3. We
        find a wide range of power-law indices, from
        p=1.4\^\{+0.5\}\_\{-0.4\} in B 1422+231to
        p=2.3\^\{+0.5\}\_\{-0.4\} in WFI J2026-4536. The measured value
        of p appears to correlate with the strength of the wavelength-
        dependent microlensing. We explore this issue with mock
        simulations using a fixed accretion disc with p = 1.5, and find
        that cases where wavelength-dependent microlensing is small tend
        to underestimate the value of p. This casts doubt on previous
        ensemble single-epoch measurements which have favoured low
        values using samples of lensed quasars that display only
        moderate chromatic effects. Using only our systems with strong
        chromatic microlensing we prefer p $\gt$ 4/3, corresponding to
        shallower temperature profiles than expected from standard thin
        disc theory.}",

        east and 1″ to the south-west. The sizes and surface
        brightnesses of the two blue sources are consistent with a
        gravitationally-lensed background galaxy. In this paper, we
        present Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) observations of
        this galaxy from the All-weather MUse Supernova Integral-field
        Nearby Galaxies (AMUSING) survey, and report the discovery of a
        background lensed galaxy at redshift 0.1915, together with other
        15 background galaxies at redshifts ranging from 0.09 to 0.9,
        that are not multiply imaged. We have extracted aperture spectra
        of the lens and all the sources and fit the stellar continuum
        with STARLIGHT to estimate their stellar and emission line
        properties. A trace of past merger and active nucleus activity
        is found in the lensing galaxy, while the background lensed
        galaxy is found to be star-forming. Modelling the lensing
        potential with a singular isothermal ellipsoid, we find an
        Einstein radius of 1\{\^``$_{.}$\}45 {\ensuremath{\pm}}

        and the STARLIGHT stellar mass within the same aperture yields a
        dark matter fraction of 18 per cent {\ensuremath{\pm}} 8 per
        cent within the Einstein radius. The advent of large surveys
        such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will discover
        a number of strong-lensed systems, and here we demonstrate how

        monitoring known galaxy-scale strong-lens systems. Strongly
        lensed SNe are potentially powerful tools for the study of
        cosmology, galaxy evolution, and stellar populations, but they
        are extremely rare. By targeting known strongly lensed star-
        forming galaxies, our strategy significantly boosts the
        detection efficiency for lensed SNe compared to a blind search.
        As a reference sample, we compile the 128 galaxy-galaxy strong-
        lens systems from the Sloan Lens ACS Survey (SLACS), the SLACS
        for the Masses Survey, and the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic
        Survey Emission-Line Lens Survey. Within this sample, we
        estimate the rates of strongly lensed Type Ia SN (SNIa) and
        core-collapse SN (CCSN) to be 1.23 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.12 and
        10.4 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 1.1 events per year, respectively. The
        lensed SN images are expected to be widely separated with a
        median separation of 2 arcsec. Assuming a conservative fiducial
        lensing magnification factor of 5 for the most highly magnified
        SN image, we forecast that a monitoring program with a single-
        visit depth of 24.7 mag (5{\ensuremath{\sigma}} point source, r
        band) and a cadence of 5 days can detect 0.49 strongly lensed
        SNIa event and 2.1 strongly lensed CCSN events per year within
        this sample. Our proposed targeted-search strategy is
        particularly useful for prompt and efficient identifications and
        follow-up observations of strongly lensed SN candidates. It also
        allows telescopes with small fields of view and limited time to
        efficiently discover strongly lensed SNe with a pencil-beam
        scanning strategy.}",

        the High-resolution Airborne Wideband Camera-plus (HAWC+)
        onboard the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy
        (SOFIA). The spectacular lensing system consists of an edge-on
        foreground disk galaxy at z = 0.22 and a nearly complete
        Einstein ring of an intrinsic ultra-luminous infrared (IR)
        galaxy at z = 1.03. Is this high IR luminosity powered by pure
        star formation (SF) or also an active galactic nucleus (AGN)?
        Previous nebular line diagnostics indicate that it is star
        formation dominated. We perform a 27-band multiwavelength
        spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling including the new
        SOFIA/HAWC+ data to constrain the fractional AGN contribution to
        the total IR luminosity. The AGN fraction in the IR turns out to
        be negligible. In addition, J1429-0028 serves as a testbed for
        comparing SED results from different models/templates and SED
        codes (MAGPHYS, SED3FIT, and CIGALE). We stress that star
        formation history is the dominant source of uncertainty in the
        derived stellar mass (as high as a factor of
        {\ensuremath{\sim}}10) even in the case of extensive photometric

        most interesting and useful observable extragalactic phenomena.
        Because their study constitutes a unique tool in various fields
        of astronomy, they are highly sought, but difficult to find.
        Even in this era of all-sky surveys, discovering them remains a
        great challenge, with barely a few hundred systems currently
        known. \textbackslash Aims: We aim to discover new multiply
        imaged quasar candidates in the recently published Gaia Data
        Release 2 (DR2), which is the astrometric and photometric all-
        sky survey with the highest spatial resolution that achieves
        effective resolutions from 0.4″ to 2.2″. \textbackslash Methods:
        We cross-matched a merged list of quasars and candidates with
        Gaia DR2 and found 1 839 143 counterparts within 0.5″. We then
        searched matches with more than two Gaia DR2 counterparts within
        6″. We further narrowed the resulting list using astrometry and
        photometry compatibility criteria between the Gaia DR2
        counterparts. A supervised machine-learning method, called
        extremely randomized trees, was finally adopted to assign a
        probability of being lensed to each remaining system.
        \textbackslash Results: We report the discovery of two quadruply
        imaged quasar candidates that are fully detected in Gaia DR2.
        These are the most promising new quasar lens candidates from
        Gaia DR2 and a simple singular isothermal ellipsoid lens model
        is able to reproduce their image positions to within 1 mas. This
        Letter demonstrates the discovery potential of Gaia for
        gravitational lenses.}",

        the intrinsic properties of high-redshift galaxy candidates, and
        properly accounting for the survey volume. We report on new
        spectroscopic redshifts of multiply imaged lensed galaxies
        behind these clusters, which are used as constraints, and detail
        our strategy to reduce systematic uncertainties due to lack of
        spectroscopic information. In addition, we quantify the
        uncertainty on the lensing magnification due to statistical and
        systematic errors related to the lens modeling process, and find
        that in all but one cluster, the magnification is constrained to
        better than 20\% in at least 80\% of the field of view,
        including statistical and systematic uncertainties. The five

        and lens redshifts 1.54 and 0.343. Images of J2257+2349 show two
        point sources separated by 1.67 arcsec on either side of an E/S0
        galaxy. The extracted spectra show two images of the same quasar
        at z$_{s}$ = 2.10. SDSS J1640+1045 has two quasar spectra at
        z$_{s}$ = 1.70 and fits to the SDSS and Pan-STARRS images
        confirm the presence of a galaxy between the two point sources.
        We observed 56 photometrically selected lens candidates in this
        follow-up campaign, confirming three new lenses, re-discovering
        one known lens, and ruling out 36 candidates, with 16 still
        inconclusive. This initial campaign demonstrates the power of
        purely photometric selection techniques in finding lensed

        Lens modelling was done by a small group of specially interested
        volunteers from the Space Warps citizen-science community who
        originally found the candidate lenses. Models are categorized
        according to seven diagnostics indicating (a) the image
        morphology and how clear or indistinct it is, (b) whether the
        mass map and synthetic lensed image appear to be plausible, and
        (c) how the lens-model mass compares with the stellar mass and
        the abundance-matched halo mass. The lensing masses range from
        {\ensuremath{\sim}}{}10$^{11}$ to $\gt${}10$^{13}$ M$_{☉}$.
        Preliminary estimates of the stellar masses show a smaller
        spread in stellar mass (except for two lenses): a factor of a
        few below or above {\ensuremath{\sim}}{}10$^{11}$ M$_{☉}$.
        Therefore, we expect the stellar-to-total mass fraction to
        decline sharply as lensing mass increases. The most massive
        system with a convincing model is J1434+522 (SW 05). The two
        low-mass outliers are J0206-095 (SW 19) and J2217+015 (SW 42);
        if these two are indeed lenses, they probe an interesting regime

        narrow-band images for eight of them demonstrating evidence of
        multiple images. Two of our systems are compound lens
        candidates, each with two background source-planes. One of these

        image. Our sample is based on 2812 galaxies observed by the
        Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA) integral field unit
        (IFU). This Spectroscopic Identification of Lensing Objects
        (SILO) survey extends the methodology of the Sloan Lens ACS
        Survey (SLACS) and BOSS Emission-Line Survey (BELLS) to lower
        redshift and multiple IFU spectra. We searched
        {\ensuremath{\sim}}1.5 million spectra, of which 3065 contained
        multiple high signal-to-noise ratio background emission-lines or
        a resolved [O ii] doublet, that are included in this catalogue.
        Upon manual inspection, we discovered regions with multiple
        spectra containing background emission-lines at the same
        redshift, providing evidence of a common source-plane geometry
        which was not possible in previous SLACS and BELLS discovery

        Einstein radius {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} 1.7 arcsec, which is
        significantly greater than seen in SLACS and BELLS. These larger
        Einstein radii produce more extended images of the background

        line will enter one of the IFU spectroscopic fibres, making

        lensed Type Ia supernovae (glSNe Ia) have the potential to
        deliver precise cosmological constraints, but the effects of
        microlensing on time delay extraction have not been studied in
        detail. Here we quantify the effect of microlensing on the glSN
        Ia yield of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and the
        effect of microlensing on the precision and accuracy of time
        delays that can be extracted from LSST glSNe Ia. Microlensing
        has a negligible effect on the LSST glSN Ia yield, but it can be
        increased by a factor of {\ensuremath{\sim}}2 over previous
        predictions to 930 systems using a novel photometric
        identification technique based on spectral template fitting.
        Crucially, the microlensing of glSNe Ia is achromatic until
        three rest-frame weeks after the explosion, making the early-
        time color curves microlensing-insensitive time delay
        indicators. By fitting simulated flux and color observations of
        microlensed glSNe Ia with their underlying, unlensed spectral
        templates, we forecast the distribution of absolute time delay
        error due to microlensing for LSST, which is unbiased at the
        sub-percent level and peaked at 1\% for color curve observations
        in the achromatic phase, while for light-curve observations it
        is comparable to state-of-the-art mass modeling uncertainties
        (4\%). About 70\% of LSST glSN Ia images should be discovered
        during the achromatic phase, indicating that microlensing time
        delay uncertainties can be minimized if prompt multicolor
        follow-up observations are obtained. Accounting for
        microlensing, the 1-2 day time delay on the recently discovered
        glSN Ia iPTF16geu can be measured to 40\% precision, limiting
        its cosmological utility.}",

        brightest gravitationally lensed sources discovered in the

        in the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV), with a total apparent
        magnitude m $_{UV}$ ≃ 19.7 mag. We report here deep
        spectroscopic observations with the Gran Telescopio Canarias of
        the optically bright lensed images of HLock01. Our results
        suggest that HLock01 is a merger system composed of the
        Herschel-selected SMG and an optically bright Lyman break-like
        galaxy (LBG), separated by only 3.3 kpc in projection. While the
        SMG appears very massive (M $_{*}$ ≃ 5 {\texttimes} {}10$^{11}$

        Detailed analysis of the high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) rest-
        frame UV spectrum of the LBG shows complex kinematics of the
        gas, exhibiting both blueshifted and redshifted absorption
        components. While the blueshifted component is associated with
        strong galactic outflows from the massive stars in the LBG, as
        is common in most star-forming galaxies, the redshifted
        component may be associated with gas inflow seen along a
        favorable sightline to the LBG. We also find evidence of an
        extended gas reservoir around HLock01 at an impact parameter of
        110 kpc, through the detection of C II
        {\ensuremath{\lambda}}{\ensuremath{\lambda}}1334 absorption in
        the red wing of a bright Ly{\ensuremath{\alpha}} emitter at z ≃
        3.327. The data presented here highlight the power of
        gravitational lensing in high S/N studies to probe deeply into

        the multiple images of these lensed quasars are typically

        are definite strong lenses with multiple lensed images. The
        foreground-lens galaxies are found to be early-type galaxies

        preferentially search for strong-lens systems with relatively
        lower lens masses than those in the pre-existing strong-lens

        factor of 2 smaller than those of the SLACS lenses, which also
        represent the typical mass scales of the current strong-lens
        samples. The extended mass coverage provided by the S4TM sample
        can enable a direct test, with the aid of strong lensing, for
        transitions in scaling relations, kinematic properties, mass

        than 20 strong lenses that have well-sampled sightline mass
        distributions, focusing on the convergence {\ensuremath{\kappa}}
        and shear {\ensuremath{\gamma}}. In 23\% of these fields, a lens
        group contributes {\ensuremath{\geq}}1\% convergence bias; in
        57\%, there is a similarly significant line-of-sight group. For

        important mass. Lens environment affects the ratio of four
        (quad) to two (double) image systems; all seven quads have lens
        groups while only 3 of 10 doubles do, and the highest

        during the Herschel Lensing snapshot Survey of massive galaxy
        clusters, and strongly lensed by the cluster MACS J0032.1+1808.
        The successful detections of its rest-frame ultraviolet (UV),
        optical, far-infrared (FIR), millimeter, and radio continua, and
        of its CO emission enable us to characterize, for the first time
        at such a high redshift, the stellar, dust, and molecular gas
        properties of a compact star-forming galaxy with a size smaller
        than 2.5 kpc, a fairly low stellar mass of 4.8$^{+
        0.5}$$_{-1.0}$ {\texttimes} {}10$^{9}$M$_{☉}$, and a moderate IR
        luminosity of 4.8$^{+ 1.2}$$_{-0.6}$ {\texttimes}
        {}10$^{11}$L$_{☉}$. By combining the stretching effect of the
        lens with the high angular resolution imaging of the CO(1-0)
        line emission and the radio continuum at 5 GHz, we find that the
        bulk of the molecular gas mass and star formation seems to be
        spatially decoupled from the rest-frame UV emission. About 90\%
        of the total star formation rate is undetected at rest-frame UV
        wavelengths because of severe obscuration by dust, but is seen
        through the thermal FIR dust emission and the radio synchrotron
        radiation. The observed CO(4-3) and CO(6-5) lines demonstrate
        that high-J transitions, at least up to J = 6, remain excited in
        this galaxy, whose CO spectral line energy distribution
        resembles that of high-redshift submm galaxies, even though the
        IR luminosity of MACSJ0032-arc is ten times lower. This high CO
        excitation is possibly due to the compactness of the galaxy. We
        find evidence that this high CO excitation has to be considered
        in the balance when estimating the CO-to-H$_{2}$ conversion
        factor. Indeed, the respective CO-to-H$_{2}$ conversion factors
        as derived from the correlation with metallicity and the FIR
        dust continuum can only be reconciled if excitation is accounted
        for. The inferred depletion time of the molecular gas in
        MACSJ0032-arc supports the decrease in the gas depletion
        timescale of galaxies with redshift, although to a lesser degree
        than predicted by galaxy evolution models. Instead, the measured
        molecular gas fraction as high as 60-79\% in MACSJ0032-arc
        favors the continued increase in the gas fraction of galaxies

        that has been reported as typical for high-{\ensuremath{\sigma}}
        ETGs based on lensing, dynamical, and stellar population

        first estimate the stellar M $_{*}$/L using lensing and stellar
        dynamics. We then fit high-quality optical spectra of the lenses

        models developed by Conroy \& van Dokkum. When examined

        contribution, when considering IMFs that extend to 0.08 M

        primarily sensitive to the Hubble constant that is key to
        probing dark energy, neutrino physics and the spatial curvature
        of the Universe, as well as discovering new physics. We present
        H0LiCOW (H$_{0}$ Lenses in COSMOGRAIL's Wellspring), a program
        that aims to measure H$_{0}$ with $\lt$3.5 per cent uncertainty
        from five lens systems (B1608+656, RXJ1131-1231, HE 0435-1223,
        WFI2033-4723 and HE 1104-1805). We have been acquiring (1) time
        delays through COSMOGRAIL and Very Large Array monitoring, (2)
        high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope imaging for the lens mass
        modelling, (3) wide-field imaging and spectroscopy to
        characterize the lens environment and (4) moderate-resolution
        spectroscopy to obtain the stellar velocity dispersion of the
        lenses for mass modelling. In cosmological models with one-
        parameter extension to flat {\ensuremath{\Lambda}} cold dark
        matter, we expect to measure H$_{0}$ to $\lt$3.5 per cent in
        most models, spatial curvature {\ensuremath{\Omega}}$_{k}$ to
        0.004, w to 0.14 and the effective number of neutrino species to
        0.2 (1{\ensuremath{\sigma}} uncertainties) when combined with
        current cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments. These
        are, respectively, a factor of {\ensuremath{\sim}}15,
        {\ensuremath{\sim}}2 and {\ensuremath{\sim}}1.5 tighter than CMB
        alone. Our data set will further enable us to study the stellar
        initial mass function of the lens galaxies, and the co-evolution
        of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies. This

        the Hubble constant. According to our lens mass models

        z$_{l}$ = 0.466 and a satellite galaxy. Here, we investigate the
        properties of the source by studying its size and luminosity
        from the imaging and the luminosity and velocity width of the
        Ly-{\ensuremath{\alpha}} line from the spectrum. Our analyses
        suggest that the source is most probably a low-luminosity active
        galactic nucleus (LLAGN) but the possibility of it being a
        compact bright galaxy (e.g. a Lyman-{\ensuremath{\alpha}}
        emitter or lyman break galaxy) cannot be excluded. The brighter
        pair of lensed images appears point-like except in the HSC I
        band (with a seeing {\ensuremath{\sim}}0.5 arcsec). The extended
        emission in the I-band image could be due to the host galaxy
        underneath the AGN, or alternatively, due to a highly compact
        lensed galaxy (without AGN) which appears point-like in all
        bands except in I band. We also find that the flux ratio of the
        brighter pair of images is different in the Ks band compared to
        optical wavelengths. Phenomena such as differential extinction
        and intrinsic variability cannot explain this chromatic
        variation. While microlensing from stars in the foreground
        galaxy is less likely to be the cause, it cannot be ruled out
        completely. If the galaxy hosts an AGN, then this represents the
        highest redshift quadruply imaged AGN known to date, enabling
        study of a distant LLAGN. Discovery of this unusually compact

        before reionization was completed. However, spectral evidence
        that MACS0647-JD lies at high redshift has proven infeasible and
        so here we seek an independent-lensing-based
        {\textquotedblleft}geometric redshift{\textquotedblright}
        derived from the angles between the three lensed images of
        MACS0647-JD, using our free-form mass model (WSLAP+) for the
        lensing cluster MACSJ0647.7+7015 (at z = 0.591). Our lens model
        uses the nine sets of multiple images, including those of
        MACS0647-JD, identified by the CLASH survey toward this cluster.
        We convincingly exclude the low-redshift regime of z $\lt$ 3,
        for which convoluted critical curves are generated by our
        method, as the solution bends to accommodate the wide angles of
        MACS0647-JD for this low redshift. Instead, a best fit to all
        sets of lensed galaxy positions and redshifts provides a
        geometric redshift of z≃ \{10.8\}$_{-0.4}$$^{+0.3}$ for
        MACS0647-JD, strongly supporting the higher photometric redshift
        solution. Importantly, we find a tight linear relation between
        the relative brightnesses of all nine sets of multiply lensed
        images and their relative magnifications as predicted by our
        model. This agreement provides a benchmark for the quality of
        the lens model, and establishes the robustness of our free-form
        lensing method for measuring model-independent geometric source
        distances and for deriving objective central cluster mass
        distributions. After correcting for its magnification the
        luminosity of MACS0647-JD remains relatively high at M$_{UV}$ =
        -19.4, which is within a factor of a few in flux of some
        surprisingly luminous z ≃ 10-11 candidates discovered recently
        in Hubble blank field surveys.}",

     abstract = "{We present an extensive spectroscopic follow-up campaign of 29 strong
        lensing (SL) selected galaxy clusters discovered primarily in
        the Second Red-Sequence Cluster Survey (RCS-2). Our
        spectroscopic analysis yields redshifts for 52 gravitational
        arcs present in the core of our galaxy clusters, which
        correspond to 35 distinct background sources that are clearly
        distorted by the gravitational potential of these clusters.
        These lensed galaxies span a wide redshift range of 0.8
        {\ensuremath{\leq}} z {\ensuremath{\leq}} 2.9, with a median
        redshift of z$_{s}$ = 1.8 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.1. We also
        measure reliable redshifts for 1004 cluster members, allowing us
        to obtain robust velocity dispersion measurements for 23 of
        these clusters, which we then use to determine their dynamical
        masses by using a simulation-based {\ensuremath{\sigma}}$_{DM}$
        - M$_{200}$ scaling relation. The redshift and mass ranges
        covered by our SL sample are 0.22 {\ensuremath{\leq}} z
        {\ensuremath{\leq}} 1.01 and 5{\texttimes}

        respectively. We analyze and quantify some possible effects that
        might bias our mass estimates, such as the presence of
        substructure, the region where cluster members are selected for
        spectroscopic follow-up, the final number of confirmed members,
        and line-of-sight effects. We find that 10 clusters of our
        sample with N$_{mem}$ {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} 20 show signs of
        dynamical substructure. However, the velocity data of only one
        system is inconsistent with a uni-modal distribution. We
        therefore assume that the substructures are only marginal and
        not of comparable size to the clusters themselves. Consequently,
        our velocity dispersion and mass estimates can be used as priors
        for SL mass reconstruction studies and also represent an
        important step toward a better understanding of the properties
        of the SL galaxy cluster population.}",

        wavelength and time domains have confirmed that the system is an
        unusual microlensing factory. The C iv emission line is
        remarkably microlensed, since the microlensing magnification of
        B relative to that for A, {\ensuremath{\mu}}$_{BA}$, reaches a
        value of 1.4 ( 0.4 mag) for its core. Moreover, the B image
        shows a red wing enhancement of C iv flux (relative to A), and
        {\ensuremath{\mu}}$_{BA}$ = 2 (0.75 mag) for the C iv broad-line
        emission. Regarding the nuclear continuum, we find a chromatic
        behaviour of {\ensuremath{\mu}}$_{BA}$, which roughly varies
        from 5 (1.75 mag) at 7000 {\r{A}} to 6 (1.95 mag) at 4000

        the r band, and this includes a number of microlensing events on
        timescales of 50-100 d. Fortunately, the presence of an
        intrinsic 0.7 mag dip in the light curves of A and B, permitted
        us to measure the time delay between both quasar images. This
        delay is {\ensuremath{\Delta}}t$_{AB}$ = 47 d

        cluster-scale strong gravitational lensing systems found in Dark
        Energy Survey data. Through visual inspection of data from the
        Science Verification season, we identified 53 candidate systems.
        We then obtained spectroscopic follow-up of 21 candidates using
        the Gemini Multi-object Spectrograph at the Gemini South
        telescope and the Inamori-Magellan Areal Camera and Spectrograph
        at the Magellan/Baade telescope. With this follow-up, we
        confirmed six candidates as gravitational lenses: three of the
        systems are newly discovered, and the remaining three were
        previously known. Of the 21 observed candidates, the remaining
        15 either were not detected in spectroscopic observations, were
        observed and did not exhibit continuum emission (or spectral
        features), or were ruled out as lensing systems. The confirmed
        sample consists of one group-scale and five galaxy-cluster-scale
        lenses. The lensed sources range in redshift z
        {\ensuremath{\sim}} 0.80-3.2 and in I-band surface brightness I
        $_{SB}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} 23-25 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ (2″

        Millimeter/submillimeter Array imaging of a sample of 47 DSFGs
        spanning z=1.9\{--\}5.7, and construct gravitational lens models
        of these sources. Our visibility-based lens modeling
        incorporates several sources of residual interferometric
        calibration uncertainty, allowing us to properly account for
        noise in the observations. At least 70\% of the sources are
        strongly lensed by foreground galaxies (\{{\ensuremath{\mu}}
        \}$_{870{\ensuremath{\mu}} \{\{m}$\}\}\textbackslashgt 2), with
        a median magnification of \{{\ensuremath{\mu}}

        \{{\ensuremath{\mu}} \}$_{870{\ensuremath{\mu}}
        \{\{m}$\}\}\textbackslashgt 30. We compare the intrinsic size
        distribution of the strongly lensed sources to a similar number
        of unlensed DSFGs and find no significant differences in spite
        of a bias between the magnification and intrinsic source size.
        This may indicate that the true size distribution of DSFGs is
        relatively narrow. We use the source sizes to constrain the
        wavelength at which the dust optical depth is unity and find
        this wavelength to be correlated with the dust temperature. This
        correlation leads to discrepancies in dust mass estimates of a
        factor of two compared to estimates using a single value for
        this wavelength. We investigate the relationship between the [C
        II] line and the far-infrared luminosity and find that the same
        correlation between the [C II]/\{L\}$_{\{\{FIR}$\}\} ratio and
        \{\{\{{\ensuremath{\Sigma}} \}\}\}$_{\{\{FIR}$\}\} found for
        low-redshift star-forming galaxies applies to high-redshift
        galaxies and extends at least two orders of magnitude higher in
        \{\{\{{\ensuremath{\Sigma}} \}\}\}$_{\{\{FIR}$\}\}. This lends
        further credence to the claim that the compactness of the IR-
        emitting region is the controlling parameter in establishing the

        galaxy is a very massive early-type galaxy with stellar mass of
        {\ensuremath{\sim}} 7{\texttimes} \{10\}$^{11}$ \{M\}$_{☉ }$
        located at \{z\}$_{\{\{L}$\}\}=0.795. The system exhibits two
        arcs/rings with clearly different colors, including several
        knots. We have performed spectroscopic follow-up observations of
        the system with FIRE on Magellan. The outer ring is confirmed at

        the inner arc and counterimage is confirmed at
        \{z\}$_{\{\{S}$\}1\}=1.302. This makes it the first double
        source plane system with spectroscopic redshifts of both

        in the outer ring are found to be offset by

        suggesting that the outer ring consists of at least two distinct
        components in the source plane. We perform lens modeling with
        two independent codes and successfully reproduce the main
        features of the system. However, two of the lensed sources
        separated by {\ensuremath{\sim}}0.7 arcsec cannot be reproduced
        by a smooth potential, and the addition of substructure to the
        lens potential is required to reproduce them. Higher-resolution

        lensing feature and potentially detect the substructure.}",

        months of data, we are observing cluster candidates in the
        southern sky in the optical imaging and spectroscopy through an
        ESO Large Programme. Inspection of ESO New Technology Telescope
        (NTT) R-and z-band imaging data from our programme has revealed
        an unusually large and bright arc in the field of PSZ1
        G311.65-18.48. We establish the basic photometric and
        morphological properties of the arc and provide conclusive
        evidence for the gravitational lensing nature of this object.
        Guided by the NTT images, we have obtained a long-slit spectrum
        with IMACS on the Magellan-I Baade Telescope, covering a part of
        the arc and the brightest cluster galaxy of PSZ1 G311.65-18.48.
        Our imaging data confirm the presence of a galaxy cluster
        coinciding (within 0.́6) with the position of the Planck SZ
        source. The arc is separated by
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde30″ from the brightest cluster
        galaxy, which closely coincides with the center of curvature of
        the arc. A photometric analysis yields integrated (Vega)
        magnitudes of (R,z,J,K$_{s}$) = (17.82,17.38,16.75,15.43) for
        the arc, more than one magnitude brighter than any previously
        known lensed arc at z \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 2-3. The
        arc is a vigorously star-forming galaxy at z = 2.369, while the
        Planck SZ cluster lens is at z = 0.443.Even when allowing for
        lensing magnifications as high as {\ensuremath{\mu}} = 100 still
        leads to the conclusion that the source galaxy is among the

        galaxy is quadruply imaged, with the brightest images magnified
        by a factor of {\ensuremath{\sim}}5. The total exposure time of
        our data is 9.8 hr on-source; however, the magnification, and
        the slit placement encompassing two images, provides a total
        equivalent exposure time of 215 hr. From this deep spectrum we
        measure a redshift of (\{z\}$_{\{spec}$\}=2.756+/- 0.001),
        making this one of the highest redshift quiescent galaxies that
        is spectroscopically confirmed. We simultaneously fit both the
        spectroscopic and photometric data to determine stellar
        population parameters and conclude that this galaxy is
        relatively young (\{560\}$_{-80}$$^{+100}$ \{Myr\}), of
        intermediate mass (\{log\} \{M\}$_{*}$/\{M\}$_{☉
        }$=\{10.59\}$_{-0.05}$$^{+0.04}$), consistent with low dust
        content (\{A\}$_{V}$=\{0.20\}$_{-0.20}$$^{+0.26}$), and has
        quenched only relatively recently. This recent quenching is
        confirmed by strong Balmer absorption, particularly
        H{\ensuremath{\delta}} (H\{{\ensuremath{\delta}}
        \}$_{A}$=\{6.66\}$_{-0.92}$$^{+0.96}$). Remarkably, this proves
        that at least some intermediate-mass galaxies have already
        quenched as early as z{\ensuremath{\sim}} 2.8. Additionally, we
        have measured a velocity dispersion of ({\ensuremath{\sigma}}
        =187+/- 43 \{km\} \{\{\{s\}\}\}$^{-1}$), making this the
        highest-redshift quiescent galaxy with a dispersion measurement.
        We confirm that this galaxy falls on the same mass fundamental
        plane (MFP) as galaxies at z = 2.2, consistent with little to no
        evolution in the MFP up to z = 2.8. Overall this galaxy is proof
        of the existence of intermediate-mass quenched galaxies in the
        distant universe, and that lensing is a powerful tool for
        determining their properties with improved accuracy.}",

        to, but does not exceed that of the first. We then build a model
        of compound lensing masses in the Universe, using singular
        isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) lenses, and assess how the optical
        depth for multiple imaging by a galaxy-galaxy compound lens
        varies with source redshift. For a source redshift of 4, we find

        based on the simulated light curves from the TDC1, is double.
        First, we test the performance of the time-delay measurement

        citizen scientists as part of the first SPACE WARPS lens search.
        The goal of the blind lens search was to identify lens
        candidates missed by robots (the RINGFINDER on galaxy scales and
        ARCFINDER on group/cluster scales) which had been previously
        used to mine the CFHTLS for lenses. We compare some properties
        of the samples detected by these algorithms to the SPACE WARPS
        sample and find them to be broadly similar. The image separation
        distribution calculated from the SPACE WARPS sample shows that
        previous constraints on the average density profile of lens
        galaxies are robust. SPACE WARPS recovers about 65 per cent of
        known lenses, while the new candidates show a richer variety
        compared to those found by the two robots. This detection rate
        could be increased to 80 per cent by only using classifications
        performed by expert volunteers (albeit at the cost of a lower
        purity), indicating that the training and performance
        calibration of the citizen scientists is very important for the

        at z = 2.636 that is multiply imaged by the cluster
        MACSJ0150.3-1005. We derive a stellar mass of
        \{log\}\{M\}$_{*}$=\{11.49\}$_{-0.16}$$^{+0.10}$ and a half-
        light radius of \{R\}$_{e,\{maj}$\}=1.8+/- 0.4 \{\{kpc\}\}.
        Taking advantage of the lensing magnification, we are able to
        spatially resolve a remarkably massive yet compact quiescent
        galaxy at z\textbackslashgt 2 in ground-based near-infrared
        spectroscopic observations using Magellan/FIRE and Keck/MOSFIRE.
        We find no gradient in the strength of the Balmer absorption
        lines over 0.6\{R\}$_{e}$-1.6\{R\}$_{e}$, which are consistent
        with an age of 760 Myr. Gas emission in [N ii] broadly traces
        the spatial distribution of the stars and is coupled with weak
        H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} emission (log [N
        ii]/\{\{H\}\}{\ensuremath{\alpha}} =0.6+/- 0.2), indicating that
        OB stars are not the primary ionizing source. The velocity
        dispersion within the effective radius is

        for the first time beyond z{\ensuremath{\sim}} 1. Using a two-
        integral Jeans model that accounts for observational effects, we
        measure a dynamical mass of
        \{log\}\{M\}$_{\{\{dyn}$\}\}=11.24+/- 0.14 and
        V/{\ensuremath{\sigma}} =0.70+/- 0.21. This is a high degree of
        rotation considering the modest observed ellipticity of 0.12
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.08, but it is consistent with predictions
        from dissipational merger simulations that produce compact
        remnants. The mass of RG1M0150 implies that it is likely to
        become a slowly rotating elliptical. If it is typical, this
        suggests that the progenitors of massive ellipticals retain
        significant net angular momentum after quenching which later
        declines, perhaps through accretion of satellites.}",

        To investigate the close proximity of the bright (m$_{AB}$ =
        25.8) Y$_{098}$-dropout to a small group of foreground galaxies,
        we obtained deep spectroscopy of the dropout and two foreground
        galaxies using VLT/X-Shooter. We detect H {\ensuremath{\alpha}},
        H {\ensuremath{\beta}}, [O III] and [O II] emission in the
        brightest two foreground galaxies (unresolved at the natural
        seeing of 0.8 arcsec), placing the pair at z = 1.327. We can
        rule out emission lines contributing all of the observed broad-
        band flux in H$_{160}$ band at 70{\ensuremath{\sigma}}, allowing
        us to exclude the z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 8 candidate as a low-
        redshift interloper with broad-band photometry dominated by
        strong emission lines. The foreground galaxy pair lies at the
        peak of the luminosity, redshift and separation distributions
        for deflectors of strongly lensed z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 8
        objects, and we make a marginal detection of a demagnified
        secondary image in the deepest (J$_{125}$) filter. We show that
        the configuration can be accurately modelled by a singular
        isothermal ellipsoidal deflector and a S{\'e}rsic source
        magnified by a factor of {\ensuremath{\mu}} = 4.3
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.2. The reconstructed source in the best-
        fitting model is consistent with luminosities and morphologies
        of z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 8 LBGs in the literature. The lens
        model yields a group mass of 9.62 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.31

        galaxies' redshifts would make this one of the few strong
        lensing deflectors discovered at z $\gt$ 1. Deeper imaging would
        allow for confirmation of the existence of the secondary image

        improvements offer the opportunity to discover up to three
        orders of magnitude more galaxy-galaxy strong lenses than are
        currently known. In this work we forecast the number of lenses
        that will be discoverable in forthcoming surveys and simulate
        their properties. We generate a population of statistically
        realistic strong lenses and simulate observations of this
        population for the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the Large Synoptic
        Survey Telescope (LSST), and Euclid surveys. We verify our model
        against the galaxy-scale lens search of the Canada-France-Hawaii
        Telescope Legacy Survey, predicting 250 discoverable lenses
        compared to 220 found by Gavazzi et al. The predicted Einstein
        radius distribution is also remarkably similar to that found by
        Sonnenfeld et al. For future surveys we find that, assuming
        Poisson limited lens galaxy subtraction, searches of the DES,
        LSST, and Euclid data sets should discover 2400, 120000, and
        170000 galaxy-galaxy strong lenses, respectively. Finders using
        blue-minus-red (g-i) difference imaging for lens subtraction can
        discover 1300 and 62000 lenses in DES and LSST. The
        uncertainties on the model are dominated by the high-redshift
        source population, which typically gives fractional errors on
        the discoverable lens number at the level of tens of percent. We
        find that doubling the signal-to-noise ratio required for a lens
        to be detectable approximately halves the number of detectable
        lenses in each survey, indicating the importance of
        understanding the selection function and the sensitivity of
        future lens finders in interpreting strong lens statistics. We
        make our population forecasting and simulated observation codes

        finders can easily be calibrated.}",

        2.2-3.6 from multiple lines obtained through a blind redshift
        search with EMIR at the IRAM 30-m telescope. Interferometry was
        obtained at IRAM and the SMA, and along with optical/near-
        infrared imaging obtained at the CFHT and the VLT reveal
        morphologies consistent with strongly gravitationally lensed
        sources, including several giant arcs. Additional photometry was
        obtained with JCMT/SCUBA-2 and IRAM/GISMO at 850
        {\ensuremath{\mu}}m and 2 mm, respectively. The SEDs of our
        sources peak near either the 350 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m or 500
        {\ensuremath{\mu}}m bands of SPIRE with peak flux densities
        between 0.35 and 1.14 Jy. All objects are extremely bright
        isolated point sources in the 18'' beam of SPIREat 250
        {\ensuremath{\mu}}m, with apparent FIR luminosities of up to 3
        {\texttimes} {}10$^{14}$ L$_{☉}$ (not correcting for the lensing
        effect). Their morphologies, sizes, CO line widths, CO
        luminosities, dust temperatures, and FIR luminosities provide
        additional empirical evidence that these are amongst the
        brightest strongly gravitationally lensed high-redshift galaxies
        on the sub-mm sky. Our programme extends the successful wide-
        area searches for strongly gravitationally lensed high-redshift
        galaxies (carried out with the South Pole Telescope and
        Herschel) towards even brighter sources, which are so rare that
        their systematic identification requires a genuine all-sky
        survey like Planck. Six sources are above the ≃600 mJy 90\%
        completeness limit of the Planck catalogue of compact sources
        (PCCS) at 545 and 857 GHz, which implies that these must
        literally be amongst the brightest high-redshift FIR and sub-mm
        sources on the extragalactic sky. We discuss their dust masses
        and temperatures, and use additional WISE 22-{\ensuremath{\mu}}m
        photometry and template fitting to rule out a significant
        contribution of AGN heating to the total infrared luminosity.
        Six sources are detected in FIRST at 1.4 GHz, and the others
        have sensitive upper limits. Four have flux densities brighter
        than expected from the local FIR-radio correlation, but in the
        range previously found for high-z sub-mm galaxies, one has a
        deficit of FIR emission, and 6 are consistent with the local
        correlation, although this includes 3 galaxies with upper
        limits. We attribute this to the turbulent interstellar medium
        of these galaxies, rather than the presence of radio AGN. The
        global dust-to-gas ratios and star-formation efficiencies of our
        sources are predominantly in the range expected from massive,
        metal-rich, intense, high-redshift starbursts. An extensive
        multi-wavelength follow-up programme is being carried out to
        further characterize these sources and the intense star
        formation within them. \textbackslash\textbackslashBased on

     abstract = "{Context. Galaxy-scale gravitational lenses are powerful tools, which can
        be used to address major astrophysical questions that are still
        open. They can be identified either through imaging or through
        spectroscopy, which is less efficient than imaging but offers
        the major advantage of having both source and deflector red
        shift previously measured at discovery. Spectroscopic
        identification requires huge data sets of high spectral quality,
        such as the SDSS, and has so far focused on early-type galaxies,
        as the most massive galaxies are found among them.
        \textbackslash Aims: We aimed to perform spectroscopic
        identification of disk galaxies acting as gravitational lenses.
        \textbackslash Methods: We have selected about 300 000 galaxy
        spectra with EW(H$_{{\ensuremath{\alpha}}}$)
        {\ensuremath{\leq}}-10 {\r{A}} from the SDSS DR 8. On these
        spectra, we ran our original code RES, which is a fast, reliable
        tool able to provide a red-shift measure and to identify
        discordant red-shift systems if present. We have required RES to
        identify only systems based on a minimum number of four emission
        lines. We have inspected all the (54) SDSS images of the double
        z systems identified by RES and discarded systems for which z
        duplicity could be easily ascribed to the presence of two
        distinct objects. The remaining 25 systems, for which double z
        is very likely to be due to the gravitational lensing
        phenomenon, constitute our sample. \textbackslash Results: For
        each gravitational lens candidate system, we provide SDSS
        identification and image emission lines detected by RES and
        activity classification, when derivable. The disky nature of our
        candidate lenses is confirmed by their images, stellar mass
        estimates, g - r rest-frame colours and occurrence of star burst
        phenomena.}",

        the posterior PDFs of the Einstein radius for 33 galaxies (18
        new and 15 from legacy SLACS data) based on single lensed
        images. We find a less-than-unity slope of 0.64

        \}$_{10}$\}\{\{{\ensuremath{\sigma}} \}$_{*}$\}-\{\{log

        which corresponds to a 6{\ensuremath{\sigma}} evidence that the
        total mass-density profile of early-type galaxies varies
        systematically in the sense of being shallower at higher lens-
        galaxy velocity dispersions. The trend is only significant when
        single-image systems are considered, highlighting the importance
        of including both {\textquotedblleft}lenses{\textquotedblright}
        and {\textquotedblleft}nonlenses{\textquotedblright} for an
        unbiased treatment of the lens population when extending to

        to the HST I-band data, we identify a strong trend of increasing
        dark-matter fraction at higher velocity dispersions, which can
        be alternatively interpreted as a trend in the stellar initial
        mass function (IMF) normalization. Consistent with previous
        findings and the suggestion of a nonuniversal IMF, we find that
        a Salpeter IMF is ruled out for galaxies with velocity
        dispersion less than 180 km s$^{-1}$. Considered together, our
        mass-profile and dark-matter fraction trends with increasing
        galaxy mass could both be explained by an increasing relative

        imaging from Herschel Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver
        (SPIRE) and PACS and Hubble Space Telescope in order to try to
        understand the nature of the sources being lensed. In the region
        of the `giant submm arc', we uncover seven multiply imaged
        galaxies (up from the previously known four), of which six are
        found to be at a redshift of z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 2.9, and
        possibly constitute an interacting system. Using a novel
        forward-modelling approach, we are able to simultaneously
        deblend and fit spectral energy distributions to the individual
        galaxies that contribute to the giant submm arc, constraining
        their dust temperatures, far-infrared luminosities, and star

        galaxy known. The lens is one of the two brightest cluster
        galaxies and lenses a background source galaxy into an arc and a
        counterimage. With Hubble Space Telescope (HST) grism and
        Keck/LRIS spectroscopy, we measure the source redshift to be z
        $_{S}$ = 2.26. Using HST imaging in ACS/F475W, ACS/F814W,
        WFC3/F125W, and WFC3/F160W, we model the lens mass distribution
        with an elliptical power-law profile and account for the effects
        of the cluster halo and nearby galaxies. The Einstein radius is
        {\ensuremath{\theta}} \_E=0.38$^{+0.02}$$_{-0.01}$ arcsec

        of the first five confirmed gravitational lensing events

        Survey (H-ATLAS). We succeed in disentangling the background
        galaxy from the lens to gain separate photometry of the two
        components. The HST data allow us to significantly improve on
        previous constraints of the mass in stars of the lensed galaxy

        described in the accompanying paper by Dye et al. We fit the

        near-IR to millimetre wavelengths and use the magnification
        factors estimated by Dye et al. to derive the intrinsic
        properties of the lensed galaxies. We find these galaxies to

        Thanks to the CLASH 16-band HST imaging, we identify the
        quintuply lensed z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 6 candidate as an optical
        dropout in the inner region of the cluster, the brightest image
        having mag$_{AB}$ = 24.8 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.1 in the f105w
        filter. We perform a detailed photometric analysis to verify its
        high-z and lensed nature. We get as photometric redshift
        z$_{ph}$ {\ensuremath{\sim}} 5.9, and given the extended nature
        and NIR colours of the lensed images, we rule out low-z early-
        type and galactic star contaminants. We perform a strong lensing
        analysis of the cluster, using 13 families of multiple lensed
        images identified in the HST images. Our final best model

        the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect has opened a new era on the
        study of the most massive clusters in the Universe.
        Multiwavelength analyses are required to understand the
        properties of these new sets of clusters, which are a sensitive
        probe of cosmology. \textbackslash Aims: We aim for a
        multiwavelength characterization of PLCK G004.5-19.5, one of the
        most massive X-ray validated SZ effect-selected galaxy clusters
        discovered by the Planck satellite. \textbackslash Methods: We
        have observed PLCK G004.5-19.5 with GMOS on the 8.1 m-Gemini
        South Telescope for optical imaging and spectroscopy, and
        performed a strong lensing analysis. We also searched for
        associated radio emission in published catalogs. \textbackslash
        Results: An analysis of the optical images confirms that this is
        a massive cluster, with a dominant central galaxy and an
        accompanying red sequence of galaxies, plus a 14″-long strong
        lensing arc. Longslit spectroscopy of six cluster members shows
        that the cluster is at z = 0.516 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.002. We
        also targeted the strongly lensed arc, and found z$_{arc}$ =
        1.601. We use LensTool to carry out a strong lensing analysis,
        from which we measure a median Einstein radius
        {\ensuremath{\theta}}$_{E}$(z$_{s}$ = 1.6) ≃ 30″ and estimate an
        enclosed mass M$_{E}$ = 2.45$_{-0.47}$$^{+0.45}$ {\texttimes}
        {}10$^{14}$ M$_{☉}$. By extrapolating a Navarro-Frenk-White
        profile, we find a total mass M$_{500}$$^{SL}$ =
        4.0$_{-1.0}$$^{+2.1}$ {\texttimes} {}10$^{14}$ M$_{☉}$. We also
        include a constraint on the mass from previous X-ray
        observations, which yields a slightly higher mass,
        M$_{500}$$^{SL+X}$ = 6.7$_{-1.3}$$^{+2.6}$ {\texttimes}
        {}10$^{14}$ M$_{☉}$, consistent with the value from strong
        lensing alone. Intermediate-resolution radio images from the
        TIFR GMRT Sky Survey at 150 MHz reveal that PLCK G004.5-19.5
        hosts a powerful radio relic on scales
        {\ensuremath{\lesssim}}500 kpc. Emission at the same location is
        also detected in low-resolution images at 843 MHz and 1.4 GHz.

        galaxy quintuply imaged by the Frontier Fields galaxy cluster
        RXC J2248.7-4431 . This sub-, high- galaxy has been recently
        discovered by Monna et al. (2013) using dropout techniques with
        the 16-band HST photometry acquired as part of the Cluster
        Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH). Obtained as
        part of the CLASH-VLT survey, the VIMOS medium-resolution
        spectra of this source show a very faint continuum between 8700
        {\r{A}} and 9300 {\r{A}} and a prominent emission line at 8643 ,
        which can be readily identified with Lyman- at . The emission
        line exhibits an asymmetric profile, with a more pronounced red
        wing. The rest-frame equivalent width of the line is ,
        relatively well constrained thanks to the detection of the UV
        continuum, which is rarely achieved for a sub- galaxy at this
        redshift. After correcting formagnification, the star formation
        rate (SFR) estimated from the Ly line is SFRLyyr and that
        estimated from the UV data is SFRUVyr. We estimate that the
        effective radius of the source is kpc, which implies a star
        formation surface mass density yrkpc and, using the Kennicutt-
        Schmidt relation, a gas surface mass density pc. Our results
        support the idea that this magnified, distant galaxy is a young
        and compact object with luminosity at , when the Universe was
        just 1 Gyr old, with a similar amount of mass in gas and stars.
        In the spirit of the Frontier Fields initiative, we also publish
        the redshifts of several multiply imaged sources and other
        background objects, which will help improving the strong-lensing
        model of this galaxy cluster. \textbackslash\textbackslashThis

        Telescope infrared imaging reveals the presence of an elliptical
        and a disk-like galaxy located almost symmetrically between the
        quasars, in a cross-like configuration. Based on absorption
        lines in the quasar spectra and the colors of the galaxies, we

        This, as well as the similarity of the quasar spectra, suggests
        that the system is a single quasar multiply imaged by a galaxy
        group or cluster acting as a gravitational lens, although the
        possibility of a binary quasar cannot be fully excluded. We show
        that the gravitational lensing hypothesis implies that these

        more conservative than if we had neglected a Bayesian

        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 10.8 and MACS1149-JD at z
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 9.6 are consistent with a
        lensed luminosity function extrapolated from lower redshifts.
        This would suggest that low-luminosity galaxies could have
        reionized the universe. However, given the significant
        uncertainties based on only two galaxies, we cannot yet rule out

        Follow-up images reveal four nearby sources: a QSO and two Lyman
        break galaxies (LBGs) at z = 2.45, and an M dwarf star. The
        brighter LBG dominates the bolometric emission. Gravitational

        relative to 350 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m implies that warm dust

        normally associated with starbursts is constrained by an upper
        limit at 1.1 mm. Radio emission is

        Survey (SWELLS) project. 15 of the lenses are taken from Paper
        I, while five are newly discovered systems. The systems are
        galaxy-galaxy lenses where the foreground deflector has an
        inclined disc, with a wide range of morphological types, from
        late-type spiral to lenticular. For each system, we compare the

        consistent with the Chabrier IMF and IMFs between the two. This
        result is consistent with previous studies of spiral galaxies
        based on independent techniques. In combination with recent

        find two radial arc candidates in SL2SJ141447+544704. From our
        sample, we detect a systematic alignment of the giant arcs with
        the major axis of the baryonic component of the putative lens in
        concordance with previous studies. This alignment is also
        observed for all arcs in the sample and does not vary
        significantly with increasing arc radius. The mean values of the
        photometric redshift distributions of lenses corresponding to
        the giant arcs and all arcs sample are at z
        \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 0.6. Owing to the large area
        and depth of the CFHTLS, we find the largest sample of lenses
        probing mass scales that are intermediate to cluster and galaxy
        lenses for the first time. We compare the observed image
        separation distribution (ISD) of our arcs with theoretical
        models. A two-component density profile for the lenses which
        accounts for both the central galaxy and the dark matter
        component is required by the data to explain the observed ISD.
        Unfortunately, current levels of uncertainties and degeneracies
        accommodate models both with and without adiabatic contraction.
        We also show the effects of changing parameters of the model
        that predict the ISD and that a larger lens sample might
        constrain relations such as the concentration-mass relation,
        mass-luminosity relation, and the faint-end slope of the
        luminosity function. \textbackslash\textbackslashBased on

        cosmological probes, as diagnostics of structural properties of
        the lensing galaxies and as tools to study the quasars
        themselves. The largest lensed quasar sample is the Sloan
        Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Quasar Lens Search (SQLS), drawn from
        the SDSS. We attempt to extend this survey using observations of
        lens candidates selected from a combination of the quasar sample
        from the SDSS and the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS).
        This adds somewhat higher image quality together with a wider
        range of wavelength for the selection process. In previous pilot
        surveys we observed five objects, finding two lenses; here we
        present further observations of 20 objects in which we find four
        lenses, of which two are independently discovered in SQLS.
        Following earlier work on the combination of these two surveys,
        we have refined our method and find that use of a colour-
        separation diagnostic, where we select for separations between
        components which appear to decrease in wavelength, is an
        efficient method to find lensed quasars and may be useful in
        ongoing and future large-scale strong lensing surveys with
        instruments such as Pan-STARRS and LSST. The new lenses have
        mostly high flux ratios, with faint secondaries buried in the
        lensing galaxy and typically 6-10 times less bright than the
        primary. Our survey brings the total number of lenses discovered
        in the SDSS quasar sample to 46, plus 13 lenses already known.
        This is likely to be up to 60-70 per cent of the total number of
        lensed quasars; we briefly discuss strategies by which the rest
        might be found.}",

        regions of spiral galaxies provides critical clues to their
        formation and evolution, but it is generally difficult to
        determine. For spiral galaxies that are strong gravitational
        lenses, however, the combination of lensing and kinematic
        observations can be used to break the disc-halo degeneracy. In
        turn, such data constrain fundamental parameters such as (i) the
        mass density profile slope and axial ratio of the dark matter
        halo, and by comparison with dark matter-only numerical
        simulations the modifications imposed by baryons; (ii) the mass
        in stars and therefore the overall star formation efficiency,
        and the amount of feedback; (iii) by comparison with stellar
        population synthesis models, the normalization of the stellar
        initial mass function. In this first paper of a series, we
        present a sample of 16 secure, one probable and six possible
        strong lensing spiral galaxies, for which multiband high-
        resolution images and rotation curves were obtained using the
        Hubble Space Telescope and Keck II telescope as part of the
        Sloan WFC Edge-on Late-type Lens Survey (SWELLS). The sample
        includes eight newly discovered secure systems. We characterize
        the sample of deflector galaxies in terms of their morphologies,
        structural parameters and stellar masses. We find that the
        SWELLS sample of secure lenses spans a broad range of
        morphologies (from lenticular to late-type spiral), spectral
        types (quantified by H{\ensuremath{\alpha}} emission) and bulge
        to total stellar mass ratio (0.22-0.85), while being limited to
        M$_{*}$ $\gt$ 10$^{10.5}$ M$_{☉}$. The SWELLS sample is thus
        well suited for exploring the relationship between dark and
        luminous matter in a broad range of galaxies. We find that the
        deflector galaxies obey the same size-mass relation as that of a
        comparison sample of elongated non-lens galaxies selected from
        the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We conclude that the SWELLS sample
        is consistent with being representative of the overall
        population of high-mass high-inclination discy galaxies.}",

        (BCS) imaging data of a z = 0.9057 galaxy that is being strongly
        lensed by a massive galaxy cluster at a redshift of z = 0.3838.
        The lens (BCS J2352-5452) was discovered while examining i- and
        z-band images being acquired in 2006 October during a BCS
        observing run. Follow-up spectroscopic observations with the
        Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph instrument on the Gemini-South
        8 m telescope confirmed the lensing nature of this system. Using
        weak-plus-strong lensing, velocity dispersion, cluster richness
        N $_{200}$, and fitting to a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) cluster
        mass density profile, we have made three independent estimates
        of the mass M $_{200}$ which are all very consistent with each
        other. The combination of the results from the three methods
        gives M $_{200}$ = (5.1 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 1.3) {\texttimes}
        {}10$^{14}$ M $_{☉}$, which is fully consistent with the
        individual measurements. The final NFW concentration c $_{200}$
        from the combined fit is c $_{200}$ = 5.4$^{+1.4}$ $_{- 1.1}$.
        We have compared our measurements of M $_{200}$ and c $_{200}$
        with predictions for (1) clusters from {\ensuremath{\Lambda}}CDM
        simulations, (2) lensing-selected clusters from simulations, and
        (3) a real sample of cluster lenses. We find that we are most
        compatible with the predictions for {\ensuremath{\Lambda}}CDM
        simulations for lensing clusters, and we see no evidence based
        on this one system for an increased concentration compared to
        {\ensuremath{\Lambda}}CDM. Finally, using the flux measured from
        the [O II]3727 line we have determined the star formation rate
        of the source galaxy and find it to be rather modest given the
        assumed lens magnification.}",

     abstract = "{We report the discovery of a unique z= 6.027 galaxy, multiply imaged by
        the cluster Abell 383 and detected in new Hubble Space Telescope
        ACS and WFC3 imaging, as well as in Warm Spitzer observations.
        This galaxy was selected as a pair of i-dropouts; its suspected
        high redshift was confirmed by the measurement of a strong Lyman
        {\ensuremath{\alpha}} line in both images using Keck/DEIMOS.
        Combining Hubble and Spitzer photometry after correcting for
        contamination by line emission (estimated to be a small effect),
        we identify a strong Balmer break of 1.5 mag. Taking into
        account the magnification factor of 11.4 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 1.9
        (2.65 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.17 mag) for the brightest image, the
        unlensed AB magnitude for the source is 27.2 {\ensuremath{\pm}}
        0.05 in the H band, corresponding to a 0.4 L* galaxy, and 25.7
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.08 at 3.6 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m. The UV slope
        is consistent with {\ensuremath{\beta}}{\ensuremath{\sim}} 2.0,
        and from the rest-frame UV continuum we measure a current star
        formation rate of 2.4 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 1.1 M$_{☉}$ yr$^{-1}$.
        The unlensed half-light radius is measured to be 300 pc, from
        which we deduce a star-forming surface density of
        {\ensuremath{\sim}}10 M$_{☉}$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$. The Lyman
        {\ensuremath{\alpha}} emission is found to be extended over
        {\ensuremath{\sim}}3 arcsec along the slit, corresponding to
        {\ensuremath{\sim}}5 kpc in the source plane. This can be
        explained by the presence of a much larger envelope of neutral
        hydrogen around the star-forming region. Finally, fitting the
        spectral energy distribution (SED) using seven photometric data
        points with simple SED models, we derive the following
        properties: very little reddening, an inferred stellar mass of
        M*= 6 {\texttimes} {}10$^{9}$ M$_{☉}$, and an inferred age of
        {\ensuremath{\sim}}800 Myr (corresponding to a redshift of
        formation of {\ensuremath{\sim}}18). The star formation rate of
        this object was likely much stronger in the past than at the
        time of observation, suggesting that we may be missing a
        fraction of galaxies at z{\ensuremath{\sim}} 6 which have
        already faded in rest-frame UV wavelengths.}",

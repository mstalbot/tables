N2  - In the third paper from the COOL-LAMPS Collaboration, we report the discovery of COOL J0542-2125, a gravitationally lensed quasar at $z=1.84$, observed as three images due to an intervening massive galaxy cluster at $z=0.61$. The lensed quasar images were identified in a search for lens systems in recent public optical imaging data and have separations on the sky up to 25".9, wider than any previously known lensed quasar. The galaxy cluster acting as a strong lens appears to be in the process of merging, with two sub-clusters separated by $\sim 1$ Mpc in the plane of the sky, and their central galaxies showing a radial velocity difference of $\sim 1000$ km/s. Both cluster cores show strongly lensed images of an assortment of background sources, as does the region between them. A preliminary strong lens model implies masses of $M(<250\ \rm{kpc}) = 1.79^{+0.16} _{-0.01} \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}$ and $M(<250\ \rm{kpc}) = 1.48^{+0.04}_{-0.10} \times 10^{14} M_{\odot}$ for the East and West sub-clusters, respectively. This line of sight is also coincident with a ROSAT ALL-sky Survey source, centered between the two confirmed cluster halos reminiscent of other major cluster-scale mergers.

N2  - We have measured the redshifts and single-aperture velocity dispersions of eight lens galaxies using the data collected by the Echellette Spectrograph and Imager (ESI) and Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (LRIS) at W.M. Keck observatory on different observing nights spread over three years (2018-2020). These results, combined with other ancillary data, such as high-resolution images of the lens systems, time delays, etc., are necessary to increase the sample size of the quasar-galaxy lens systems for which the Hubble constant can be measured, using the time-delay strong lensing method, hence increasing the precision of its inference. Typically, the 2D spectra of the quasar-galaxy lens systems get spatially blended due to seeing by ground-based observations. As a result, the extracted lensing galaxy (deflector) spectra become significantly contaminated by quasar light, which affects the ability to extract meaningful information about the deflector. To account for spatial blending and extract less contaminated and higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) 1D spectra of the deflectors, a forward modeling method has been implemented. From the extracted spectra, we have measured redshifts using prominent absorption lines and single aperture velocity dispersions using the penalized pixel fitting code pPXF. In this paper, we report the redshifts and single aperture velocity dispersions of eight lens galaxies - J0147+4630, B0445+123, B0631+519, J0659+1629, J0818-2613, J0924+0219, J1433+6007, and J1817+2729. Among these systems, six do not have previously measured velocity dispersions; for the other two, our measurements are consistent with previously reported values. Additionally, we have measured the previously unknown redshifts of the deflectors in J0818-2613 and J1817+2729 to be $0.866 \pm 0.002$ and $0.408 \pm 0.002$, respectively.

N2  - We have conducted a search for strong gravitational lensing systems in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Legacy Imaging Surveys Data Release 9. This is the third paper in a series (following Huang et al. 2020; Huang et al. 2021, Paper I & II, respectively). These surveys together cover $\sim$ 19,000 deg$^2$ visible from the northern hemisphere, reaching a z-band AB magnitude of $\sim$ 22.5. We use a deep residual neural network, trained on a compilation of known lensing systems and candidates as well as non-lenses in the same footprint. After applying our trained neural networks to the survey data, we visually inspect and rank images with probabilities above a threshold. We have found 1895 lens candidates. Out of these, 1512 are identified for the first time. Combining the discoveries from this work, Paper I (335) and II (1210), the total number of strong lens candidates from the Legacy Surveys that we have discovered is 3057.

N2  - We report the spectroscopic follow-up of 175 lensed quasar candidates selected using Gaia Data Release 2 observations following Lemon et al. 2019. Systems include 86 confirmed lensed quasars and a further 17 likely lensed quasars based on imaging and/or similar spectra. We also confirm 11 projected quasar pairs and 11 physical quasar pairs, while 25 systems are left as unclassified quasar pairs -- pairs of quasars at the same redshift, which could be either distinct quasars or potential lensed quasars. Especially interesting objects include 8 quadruply imaged quasars of which two have BAL sources, an apparent triple, and a doubly lensed LoBaL quasar. The source redshifts and image separations of these new lenses range between 0.65 - 3.59 and 0.78 - 6.23 arcseconds respectively. We compare the known population of lensed quasars to an updated mock catalogue at image separations between 1 and 4 arcseconds, showing a very good match at z<1.5. At z>1.5, only 47% of the predicted number are known, with 56% of these missing lenses at image separations below 1.5 arcseconds. The missing higher-redshift, small-separation systems will have fainter lensing galaxies, and are partially explained by the unclassified quasar pairs and likely lenses presented in this work, which require deeper imaging. Of the 11 new reported projected quasar pairs, 5 have impact parameters below 10 kpc, almost tripling the number of such systems, which can probe the innermost regions of quasar host galaxies through absorption studies. We also report four new lensed galaxies discovered through our searches, with source redshifts ranging from 0.62 to 2.79.

N2  - Combining the exquisite angular resolution of Gaia with optical light curves and WISE photometry, the Gaia Gravitational Lenses group (GraL) uses machine-learning techniques to identify candidate strongly lensed quasars, and has confirmed over two dozen new strongly lensed quasars from the Gaia Data Release 2. This paper reports on the 12 quadruply imaged quasars identified by this effort to date, which is a ~20% increase in the total number of confirmed quadruply imaged quasars. We discuss the candidate selection, spectroscopic follow-up, and lens modeling. We also report our spectroscopic failures as an aid for future investigations.

N2  - We present a lensed quasar search based on the variability of lens systems in the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) transient survey. Starting from 101 353 variable objects with i-band photometry in the HSC transient survey, we used a variability-based lens search method measuring the spatial extent in difference images to select potential lensed quasar candidates. We adopted conservative constraints in this variability selection and obtained 83 657 variable objects as possible lens candidates. We then ran CHITAH, a lens search algorithm based on the image configuration, on those 83 657 variable objects, and 2130 variable objects were identified as potential lensed objects. We visually inspected the 2130 variable objects, and seven of them are our final lensed quasar candidates. Additionally, we found one lensed galaxy candidate as a serendipitous discovery. Among the eight final lensed candidates, one is the only known quadruply lensed quasar in the survey field, HSCJ095921+020638. None of the other seven lensed candidates have been previously classified as a lens nor a lensed candidate. Three of the five final candidates with available Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images, including HSCJ095921+020638, show clues of a lensed feature in the HST images. We show that a tightening of our variability selection criteria might result in the loss of possible lensed quasar candidates, especially the lensed quasars with faint brightness or narrow separation, without efficiently eliminating the non-lensed objects; CHITAH is therefore important as an advanced examination to improve the lens search efficiency through the object configuration. The recovery of HSCJ095921+020638 proves the effectiveness of the variability-based lens search method, and this lens search method can be used in other cadenced imaging surveys, such as the upcoming Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time.

N2  - We present spectroscopic confirmation of three new two-image gravitationally lensed quasars, compiled from existing strong lens and X-ray catalogues. Images of HSC J091843.27-022007.5 show a red galaxy with two blue point sources at either side, separated by 2.26 arcsec. This system has a source and a lens redshifts z<SUB>s</SUB> = 0.804 and z<SUB>ℓ</SUB> = 0.459, respectively, as obtained by our follow-up spectroscopic data. CXCO J100201.50+020330.0 shows two point sources separated by 0.85 arcsec on either side of an early-type galaxy. The follow-up spectroscopic data confirm the fainter quasar has the same redshift with the brighter quasar from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) fiber spectrum at z<SUB>s</SUB> = 2.016. The deflecting foreground galaxy is a typical early-type galaxy at a redshift of z<SUB>ℓ</SUB> = 0.439. SDSS J135944.21+012809.8 has two point sources with quasar spectra at the same redshift z<SUB>s</SUB> = 1.096, separated by 1.05 arcsec, and fits to the HSC images confirm the presence of a galaxy between these. These discoveries demonstrate the power of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP)'s deep imaging and wide sky coverage. Combined with existing X-ray source catalogues and follow-up spectroscopy, the HSC-SSP provides us unique opportunities to find multiple-image quasars lensed by a foreground galaxy.

We use deep residual neural networks, building on previous work presented by Huang et al. These surveys together cover approximately one-third of the sky visible from the Northern Hemisphere, reaching a z-band AB magnitude of ∼22.5. We compile a training sample that consists of known lensing systems as well as non-lenses in the Legacy Surveys and the Dark Energy Survey. After applying our trained neural networks to the survey data, we visually inspect and rank images with probabilities above a threshold. Here we present 1210 new strong lens candidates.

N2  - Strong gravitational lenses are a rare and instructive type of astronomical object. Identification has long relied on serendipity, but different strategies—such as mixed spectroscopy of multiple galaxies along the line of sight, machine-learning algorithms, and citizen science—have been employed to identify these objects as new imaging surveys become available. We report on the comparison between spectroscopic, machine-learning, and citizen-science identification of galaxy-galaxy lens candidates from independently constructed lens catalogs in the common survey area of the equatorial fields of the Galaxy and Mass Assembly survey. In these, we have the opportunity to compare high completeness spectroscopic identifications against high-fidelity imaging from the Kilo Degree Survey used for both machine-learning and citizen-science lens searches. We find that the three methods—spectroscopy, machine learning, and citizen science—identify 47, 47, and 13 candidates, respectively, in the 180 square degrees surveyed. These identifications barely overlap, with only two identified by both citizen science and machine learning. We have traced this discrepancy to inherent differences in the selection functions of each of the three methods, either within their parent samples (i.e., citizen science focuses on low redshift) or inherent to the method (i.e., machine learning is limited by its training sample and prefers well-separated features, while spectroscopy requires sufficient flux from lensed features to lie within the fiber). These differences manifest as separate samples in estimated Einstein radius, lens stellar mass, and lens redshift. The combined sample implies a lens candidate sky density of ∼0.59 deg<SUP>-2</SUP> and can inform the construction of a training set spanning a wider mass-redshift space. A combined approach and refinement of automated searches would result in a more complete sample of galaxy-galaxy lens candidates for future surveys.

N2  - Context. Strong lenses are extremely useful probes of the distribution of matter on galaxy and cluster scales at cosmological distances, however, they are rare and difficult to find. The number of currently known lenses is on the order of 1000. <BR /> Aims: The aim of this study is to use crowdsourcing to carry out a lens search targeting massive galaxies selected from over 442 square degrees of photometric data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey. <BR /> Methods: Based on the S16A internal data release of the HSC survey, we chose a sample of ∼300 000 galaxies with photometric redshifts in the range of 0.2 < z<SUB>phot</SUB> < 1.2 and photometrically inferred stellar masses of log M<SUB>*</SUB> > 11.2. We crowdsourced lens finding on this sample of galaxies on the Zooniverse platform as part of the Space Warps project. The sample was complemented by a large set of simulated lenses and visually selected non-lenses for training purposes. Nearly 6000 citizen volunteers participated in the experiment. In parallel, we used YATTALENS, an automated lens-finding algorithm, to look for lenses in the same sample of galaxies. <BR /> Results: Based on a statistical analysis of classification data from the volunteers, we selected a sample of the most promising ∼1500 candidates, which we then visually inspected: half of them turned out to be possible (grade C) lenses or better. By including lenses found by YATTALENS or serendipitously noticed in the discussion section of the Space Warps website, we were able to find 14 definite lenses (grade A), 129 probable lenses (grade B), and 581 possible lenses. YATTALENS found half the number of lenses that were discovered via crowdsourcing. <BR /> Conclusions: Crowdsourcing is able to produce samples of lens candidates with high completeness, when multiple images are clearly detected, and with higher purity compared to the currently available automated algorithms. A hybrid approach, in which the visual inspection of samples of lens candidates pre-selected by discovery algorithms or coupled to machine learning is crowdsourced, will be a viable option for lens finding in the 2020s, with forthcoming wide-area surveys such as LSST, Euclid, and WFIRST. <P />Full list of lens candidates with grade C and better are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A> (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via <A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/642/A148">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/642/A148</A>

N2  - We present the results of 15 years of monitoring lensed quasars, which was conducted by the COSMOGRAIL programme at the Leonhard Euler 1.2 m Swiss Telescope. The decade-long light curves of 23 lensed systems are presented for the first time. We complement our data set with other monitoring data available in the literature to measure the time delays in 18 systems, among which nine reach a relative precision better than 15% for at least one time delay. To achieve this, we developed an automated version of the curve-shifting toolbox PyCS to ensure robust estimation of the time delay in the presence of microlensing, while accounting for the errors due to the imperfect representation of microlensing. We also re-analysed the previously published time delays of RX J1131-1231 and HE 0435-1223, by adding six and two new seasons of monitoring, respectively, and confirming the previous time-delay measurements. When the time delay measurement is possible, we corrected the light curves of the lensed images from their time delay and present the difference curves to highlight the microlensing signal contained in the data. To date, this is the largest sample of decade-long lens monitoring data, which is useful to measure H<SUB>0</SUB> and the size of quasar accretion discs with microlensing as well as to study quasar variability. <P />All light curves presented in this paper are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A> (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via <A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/640/A105">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/640/A105</A>

N2  - We present a blind time-delay cosmographic analysis for the lens system DES J0408-5354. This system is extraordinary for the presence of two sets of multiple images at different redshifts, which provide the opportunity to obtain more information at the cost of increased modelling complexity with respect to previously analysed systems. We perform detailed modelling of the mass distribution for this lens system using three band Hubble Space Telescope imaging. We combine the measured time delays, line-of-sight central velocity dispersion of the deflector, and statistically constrained external convergence with our lens models to estimate two cosmological distances. We measure the 'effective' time-delay distance corresponding to the redshifts of the deflector and the lensed quasar $D_{\Delta t}^{\rm eff}=$ $3382_{-115}^{+146}$ Mpc and the angular diameter distance to the deflector D<SUB>d</SUB> = $1711_{-280}^{+376}$ Mpc, with covariance between the two distances. From these constraints on the cosmological distances, we infer the Hubble constant H<SUB>0</SUB>= $74.2_{-3.0}^{+2.7}$ km s<SUP>-1 </SUP>Mpc<SUP>-</SUP><SUP>1</SUP> assuming a flat ΛCDM cosmology and a uniform prior for Ω<SUB>m</SUB> as $\Omega _{\rm m} \sim \mathcal {U}(0.05, 0.5)$ . This measurement gives the most precise constraint on H<SUB>0</SUB> to date from a single lens. Our measurement is consistent with that obtained from the previous sample of six lenses analysed by the H<SUB>0</SUB> Lenses in COSMOGRAIL's Wellspring (H0LiCOW) collaboration. It is also consistent with measurements of H<SUB>0</SUB> based on the local distance ladder, reinforcing the tension with the inference from early Universe probes, for example, with 2.2σ discrepancy from the cosmic microwave background measurement.

N2  - We report the largest sample of candidate strong gravitational lenses belonging to the Survey of Gravitationally lensed Objects in HSC Imaging for group-to-cluster scale (SuGOHI-c) systems. These candidates are compiled from the S18A data release of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) Survey. We visually inspect ∼39 500 galaxy clusters, selected from several catalogues, overlapping with the Wide, Deep, and UltraDeep fields, spanning the cluster redshift range of 0.05 < z<SUB>cl</SUB> < 1.38. We discover 641 candidate lens systems, of which 536 are new. From the full sample, 47 are almost certainly bona fide lenses, 181 of them are highly probable lenses, and 413 are possible lens systems. Additionally, we present 131 lens candidates at galaxy scale serendipitously discovered during the inspection. We obtained spectroscopic follow-up of 10 candidates using the X-shooter. With this follow-up, we confirm eight systems as strong gravitational lenses. Of the remaining two, one of the sources is too faint to detect any emission, and the other has a tentative redshift close to the lens redshift, but additional arcs in this system are yet to be observed spectroscopically. Since the HSC-SSP is an ongoing survey, we expect to find ∼600 definite or probable lenses using this procedure and even more if combined with other lens finding methods.

N2  - We describe the observation and confirmation of nine new strong gravitational lenses discovered in Year 1 data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We created candidate lists based on (i) galaxy group and cluster samples, and (ii) photometrically selected galaxy samples. We selected 46 candidates through visual inspection and then used the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) at the Gemini South telescope to acquire a spectroscopic follow-up of 21 of these candidates. Through an analysis of these spectroscopic follow-up data, we confirmed nine new lensing systems and rejected two candidates, and the analysis was inconclusive on 10 candidates. For each of the confirmed systems, our report measured spectroscopic properties, estimated source image-lens separations, and estimated enclosed masses as well. The sources that we targeted have an i-band surface brightness range of $i_{\rm SB} \sim 22\!-\!24\, {\rm mag}\,{\rm arcsec}^{-2}$ and a spectroscopic redshift range of z<SUB>spec</SUB> ∼ 0.8-2.6. The lens galaxies have a photometric redshift range of z<SUB>lens</SUB> ∼ 0.3-0.7. The lensing systems range in source image-lens separation from 2 to 9 arcsec and in enclosed mass from 10<SUP>12</SUP> to 10<SUP>13</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>.

N2  - We report the results of the STRong lensing Insights into the Dark Energy Survey (STRIDES) follow-up campaign of the late 2017/early 2018 season. We obtained spectra of 65 lensed quasar candidates with ESO Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera 2 on the NTT and Echellette Spectrograph and Imager on Keck, confirming 10 new lensed quasars and 10 quasar pairs. Eight lensed quasars are doubly imaged with source redshifts between 0.99 and 2.90, one is triply imaged (DESJ0345-2545, z = 1.68), and one is quadruply imaged (quad: DESJ0053-2012, z = 3.8). Singular isothermal ellipsoid models for the doubles, based on high-resolution imaging from SAMI on Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope or Near InfraRed Camera 2 on Keck, give total magnifications between 3.2 and 5.6, and Einstein radii between 0.49 and 1.97 arcsec. After spectroscopic follow-up, we extract multi-epoch grizY photometry of confirmed lensed quasars and contaminant quasar + star pairs from DES data using parametric multiband modelling, and compare variability in each system's components. By measuring the reduced χ<SUP>2</SUP> associated with fitting all epochs to the same magnitude, we find a simple cut on the less variable component that retains all confirmed lensed quasars, while removing 94 per cent of contaminant systems. Based on our spectroscopic follow-up, this variability information improves selection of lensed quasars and quasar pairs from 34-45 per cent to 51-70 per cent, with most remaining contaminants being star-forming galaxies. Using mock lensed quasar light curves we demonstrate that selection based only on variability will over-represent the quad fraction by 10 per cent over a complete DES magnitude-limited sample, explained by the magnification bias and hence lower luminosity/more variable sources in quads.

N2  - We perform a semi-automated search for strong gravitational lensing systems in the 9000 deg<SUP>2</SUP> Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS), part of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Legacy Imaging Surveys. The combination of the depth and breadth of these surveys are unparalleled at this time, making them particularly suitable for discovering new strong gravitational lensing systems. We adopt the deep residual neural network architecture developed by Lanusse et al. for the purpose of finding strong lenses in photometric surveys. We compile a training sample that consists of known lensing systems in the Legacy Surveys and the Dark Energy Survey as well as non-lenses in the footprint of DECaLS. In this paper we show the results of applying our trained neural network to the cutout images centered on galaxies typed as ellipticals in DECaLS. The images that receive the highest scores (probabilities) are visually inspected and ranked. Here we present 335 candidate strong lensing systems, identified for the first time.

N2  - Low-redshift strong-lensing galaxies can provide robust measurements of the stellar mass-to-light ratios in early-type galaxies (ETGs), and hence constrain variations in the stellar initial mass function (IMF). At present, only a few such systems are known. Here, we report the first results from a blind search for gravitationally lensed emission-line sources behind 52 massive z < 0.07 ETGs with Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) integral field spectroscopy. For 16 galaxies, new observations were acquired, whilst the other 36 were analysed from archival data. This project has previously yielded one confirmed galaxy-scale strong lens (J0403-0239) that we report in an earlier paper. J0403-0239 has since received follow-up observations, presented here, which indicate support for our earlier IMF results. Three cluster-scale, and hence dark-matter-dominated, lensing systems were also discovered (central galaxies of A4059, A2052, and AS555). For nine further galaxies, we detect a singly imaged but closely projected source within 6 arcsec (including one candidate with sources at three different redshifts); such cases can be exploited to derive upper limits on the IMF mass-excess factor, α. Combining the new lens and new upper limits, with the previously discovered systems, we infer an average <α> = 1.06 ± 0.08 (marginalized over the intrinsic scatter), which is inconsistent with a Salpeter-like IMF (α = 1.55) at the 6σ level. We test the detection threshold in these short-exposure MUSE observations with the injection and recovery of simulated sources, and predict that one in 25 observations is expected to yield a new strong-lens system. Our observational results are consistent with this expected yield.

N2  - Strong gravitationally lensed quasars provide a powerful means to study galaxy evolution and cosmology. We use CHITAH, which is an algorithm used to hunt for new lens systems, particularly lensed quasars, in the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC SSP) S16A. We present 46 lens candidates, of which 3 are previously known. We select four high-grade candidates from CHITAH for spectroscopic follow-up observations, and include two additional lenses found by YATTALENS, an algorithm used to classify lensed galaxies. We obtain X-shooter spectra of these six promising candidates for lens confirmation and redshift measurements. We report new spectroscopic redshift measurements for both the lens and source galaxies in four lens systems. We apply the lens modeling software GLEE to model our six X-shooter lenses uniformly. Through our analysis of the HSC images, we find that HSCJ022622-042522, HSCJ115252+004733, and HSCJ141136-010216 have point-like lensed images, and that the lens light distribution is well aligned with the lens mass distribution within 6 deg. We estimate the fluxes of the lensed source emission lines using X-shooter spectra, and use line ratio as a diagnostic on the Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagram. As a result, we find that HSCJ022622-042522 has a probable quasar source based on the upper limit of the [N II] flux intensity. We also measure the FWHM of Lyα emission of HSCJ141136-010216 to be ∼233 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, showing that it is a probable Lyman-α emitter.

N2  - Binary quasars are extremely rare objects, used to investigate clustering on very small scales at different redshifts. The cases where the two quasar components are gravitationally bound, known as physical binary quasars, can also exhibit enhanced astrophysical activity and therefore are of particular scientific interest. Here we present the serendipitous discovery of a physical pair of quasars with an angular separation of Δθ = (8.76 ± 0.11)″. The redshifts of the two quasars are consistent within the errors and measured as z = (1.76 ± 0.01). Under the motivated assumption that the pair does not arise from a single gravitationally lensed quasar, the resulting projected physical separation was estimated as (76 ± 1) kpc. For both targets we detected Si iv, C iv, C iii], and Mg ii emission lines. However, the two quasars show significantly different optical colors, one being among the most reddened quasars at z > 1.5 and the other with colors consistent with typical quasar colors at the same redshift. Therefore it is ruled out that the sources are a lensed system. This is our second serendipitous discovery of a pair of two quasars with different colors, having a separation ≲10″, which extends the catalog of known small-separation quasar pairs.

N2  - We serendipitously discovered in the Herschel Reference Survey an extremely bright infrared source with S<SUB>500</SUB> ∼ 120 mJy in the line of sight of the Virgo cluster which we name Red Virgo 4 (RV4). Based on IRAM/EMIR and IRAM/NOEMA detections of the CO(5-4), CO(4-3), and [CI] lines, RV4 is located at a redshift of 4.724, yielding a total observed infrared luminosity of 1.1 ± 0.6 × 10<SUP>14</SUP> L<SUB>⊙</SUB>. At the position of the Herschel emission, three blobs are detected with the VLA at 10 cm. The CO(5-4) line detection of each blob confirms that they are at the same redshift with the same line width, indicating that they are multiple images of the same source. In Spitzer and deep optical observations, two sources, High-z Lens 1 (HL1) West and HL1 East, are detected at the center of the three VLA/NOEMA blobs. These two sources are placed at z = 1.48 with X-shooter spectra, suggesting that they could be merging and gravitationally lensing the emission of RV4. HL1 is the second most distant lens known to date in strong lensing systems. Constrained by the position of the three VLA/NOEMA blobs, the Einstein radius of the lensing system is 2.2″ ± 0.2 (20 kpc). The high redshift of HL1 and the large Einstein radius are highly unusual for a strong lensing system. In this paper, we present the insterstellar medium properties of the background source RV4. Different estimates of the gas depletion time yield low values suggesting that RV4 is a starburst galaxy. Among all high-z submillimeter galaxies, this source exhibits one of the lowest L<SUB>[CI]</SUB> to L<SUB>IR</SUB> ratios, 3.2 ± 0.9 × 10<SUP>-6</SUP>, suggesting an extremely short gas depletion time of only 14 ± 5 Myr. It also shows a relatively high L<SUB>[CI]</SUB> to L<SUB>CO(4-3)</SUB> ratio (0.7 ± 0.2) and low L<SUB>CO(5-4)</SUB> to L<SUB>IR</SUB> ratio (only ∼50% of the value expected for normal galaxies) hinting at low density of gas. Finally, we discuss the short depletion time of RV4. It can be explained by either a very high star formation efficiency, which is difficult to reconcile with major mergers simulations of high-z galaxies, or a rapid decrease of star formation, which would bias the estimate of the depletion time toward an artificially low value.

N2  - We present new observations of two z = 0.12 strong-lensing elliptical galaxies, originally discovered from the SDSS-IV MaNGA survey, using the new FOCAS IFU spectrograph on the Subaru Telescope. For J1436+4943, our observations confirm the identification of this system as a multiple-image lens, in a cusp configuration, with an Einstein radius θ<SUB>Ein</SUB> = 2.0 arcsec. For J1701+3722, the improved data confirm earlier hints of a complex source plane, with different configurations evident in different emission lines. The new observations reveal a previously unseen inner counter-image to the [O III] arc found from MaNGA, leading to a smaller revised Einstein radius of θ<SUB>Ein</SUB> = 1.6 arcsec. The inferred projected masses within the Einstein apertures (3.7-4.7 kpc) are consistent with being dominated by stars with an initial mass function (IMF) similar to that of the Milky Way, and a dark matter contribution of ∼35 per cent as supported from cosmological simulations. These results are consistent with `pure lensing' analyses of lower redshift lenses, but contrast with claims for heavier IMFs from combined lensing and dynamical studies of more distant early-type galaxies.

N2  - Massive foreground galaxy clusters magnify and distort the light of objects behind them, permitting a view into both the extremely distant and intrinsically faint galaxy populations. We present here the $z\sim 6\mbox{--}8$ candidate high-redshift galaxies from the Reionization Lensing Cluster Survey (RELICS), a Hubble and Spitzer Space Telescope survey of 41 massive galaxy clusters spanning an area of ≈200 arcmin<SUP>2</SUP>. These clusters were selected to be excellent lenses, and we find similar high-redshift sample sizes and magnitude distributions as the Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH). We discover 257, 57, and eight candidate galaxies at z ∼ 6, 7, and 8 respectively, (322 in total). The observed (lensed) magnitudes of the z ∼ 6 candidates are as bright as AB mag ∼23, making them among the brightest known at these redshifts, comparable with discoveries from much wider, blank-field surveys. RELICS demonstrates the efficiency of using strong gravitational lenses to produce high-redshift samples in the epoch of reionization. These brightly observed galaxies are excellent targets for follow-up study with current and future observatories, including the James Webb Space Telescope.

N2  - Because follow-up observations of quadruple gravitational lens systems are of extraordinary importance for astrophysics and cosmology, we present single-epoch optical spectra and r-band light curves of PS J0147+4630. This recently discovered system mainly consists of four images ABCD of a background quasar around a foreground galaxy G that acts as a gravitational lens. First, we use long-slit spectroscopic data in the Gemini Observatory Archive and a multi-component fitting to accurately resolve the spectra of A, D, and G. The spectral profile of G resembles that of an early-type galaxy at a redshift of 0.678 ± 0.001, which is about 20% higher than the previous estimate. Additionally, the stellar velocity dispersion is measured to ∼5% precision. Second, our early r-band monitoring with the Liverpool Telescope leads to accurate light curves of the four quasar images. Adopting time delays predicted by the lens model, the new lens redshift, and a standard cosmology, we report the detection of microlensing variations in C and D as large as ∼0.1 mag on timescales of a few hundred days. We also estimate an actual delay between A and B of a few days (B is leading), which demonstrates the big potential of optical monitoring campaigns of PS J0147+4630.

N2  - Context. The KiDS Strongly lensed QUAsar Detection project (KiDS-SQuaD) is aimed at finding as many previously undiscovered gravitational lensed quasars as possible in the Kilo Degree Survey. This is the second paper of this series where we present a new, automatic object-classification method based on the machine learning technique. <BR /> Aims: The main goal of this paper is to build a catalogue of bright extragalactic objects (galaxies and quasars) from the KiDS Data Release 4, with minimum stellar contamination and preserving the completeness as much as possible. We show here that this catalogue represents the perfect starting point to search for reliable gravitationally lensed quasar candidates. <BR /> Methods: After testing some of the most used machine learning algorithms, decision-tree-based classifiers, we decided to use CatBoost, which was specifically trained with the aim of creating a sample of extragalactic sources that is as clean of stars as possible. We discuss the input data, define the training sample for the classifier, give quantitative estimates of its performances, and finally describe the validation results with Gaia DR2, AllWISE, and GAMA catalogues. <BR /> Results: We built and made available to the scientific community the KiDS Bright EXtraGalactic Objects catalogue (KiDS-BEXGO), specifically created to find gravitational lenses but applicable to a wide number of scientific purposes. The KiDS-BEXGO catalogue is made of ≈6 million sources classified as quasars (≈200 000) and galaxies (≈5.7 M) up to r < 22<SUP>m</SUP>. To demonstrate the potential of the catalogue in the search for strongly lensed quasars, we selected ≈950 "Multiplets": close pairs of quasars or galaxies surrounded by at least one quasar. We present cutouts and coordinates of the 12 most reliable gravitationally lensed quasar candidates. We showed that employing a machine learning method decreases the stellar contaminants within the gravitationally lensed candidates, comparing the current results to the previous ones, presented in the first paper from this series. <BR /> Conclusions: Our work presents the first comprehensive identification of bright extragalactic objects in KiDS DR4 data, which is, for us, the first necessary step towards finding strong gravitational lenses in wide-sky photometric surveys, but has also many other more general astrophysical applications. <P />The KiDS Bright EXtraGalactic Objects (KiDS-BEXGO) catalogue is also available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A> (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via <A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/632/A56">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/632/A56</A>

N2  - The discovery of multiply-imaged gravitationally lensed QSOs is fundamental to many astronomical and cosmological studies. However, these objects are rare and challenging to discover due to requirements of high-angular resolution astrometric, multiwavelength photometric and spectroscopic data. This has limited the number of known systems to a few hundred objects. We aim to reduce the constraints on angular resolution and discover multiply-imaged QSO candidates by using new candidate selection principles based on unresolved photometric time-series and ground-based images from public surveys. We selected candidates for multiply-imaged QSOs based on low levels of entropy computed from Catalina unresolved photometric time-series or Euclidean similarity to known lenses in a space defined by the wavelet power spectra of Pan-STARSS DR2 or DECaLS DR7 images, combined with multiple {\it Gaia} DR2 sources or large astrometric errors and supervised and unsupervised learning methods. We then confirmed spectroscopically some candidates with the Palomar Hale, Keck-I, and ESO/NTT telescopes. Here we report the discovery and confirmation of seven doubly-imaged QSOs and one likely double quasar. This demonstrates the potential of combining space-astrometry, even if unresolved, with low spatial-resolution photometric time-series and/or low-spatial resolution multi-band imaging to discover multiply-imaged lensed QSOs.

N2  - We have scanned 5000 deg<SUP>2</SUP> of Southern Sky to search for strongly lensed quasars with five methods, all source oriented, but based on different assumptions and selection criteria. We present a list of high-grade candidates from each method (totalling 98 unique, new candidates), to facilitate follow-up spectroscopic campaigns, including two previously unknown quadruplets, WG 210014.9-445206.4 and WG 021416.37-210535.3. We analyse morphological searches based on Gaia multiplet detection and astrometric offsets, fibre-spectroscopic pre-selection, and X-ray and radio pre-selection. The performance and complementarity of the methods are evaluated on a common sample of known lenses in the Dark Energy Survey public Data Release 1 (DR1) footprint. We recovered in total 13 known lenses, of which 8 are quadruplets. Morphological and colour selection of objects, from the WISE andGaia-DR2 surveys, recovers most of those known lenses, but searches in the radio and X-ray cover regimes that are beyond the completeness of Gaia. Given the footprint, pre-selection, and depth limits, the current number of quads indicates that the union of these searches is complete, and the expected purity on high-grade candidates is {≈}60{{ per cent}}. Ongoing, spectroscopic campaigns confirm this estimate.

N2  - Large surveys of galaxy clusters with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Spitzer, including the Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble and the Frontier Fields, have demonstrated the power of strong gravitational lensing to efficiently deliver large samples of high-redshift galaxies. We extend this strategy through a wider, shallower survey named RELICS, the Reionization Lensing Cluster Survey, described here. Our 188-orbit Hubble Treasury Program observed 41 clusters at 0.182 ≤ z ≤ 0.972 with Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) and WFC3/IR imaging spanning 0.4-1.7 μm. We selected 21 of the most massive clusters known based on Planck PSZ2 estimates and 20 additional clusters based on observed or inferred lensing strength. RELICS observed 46 WFC3/IR pointings (∼200 arcmin<SUP>2</SUP>) each with two orbits divided among four filters (F105W, F125W, F140W, and F160W) and ACS imaging as needed to achieve single-orbit depth in each of three filters (F435W, F606W, and F814W). As previously reported by Salmon et al., we discovered over 300 z ∼ 6-10 candidates, including the brightest z ∼ 6 candidates known, and the most distant spatially resolved lensed arc known at z ∼ 10. Spitzer IRAC imaging (945 hr awarded, plus 100 archival, spanning 3.0-5.0 μm) has crucially enabled us to distinguish z ∼ 10 candidates from z ∼ 2 interlopers. For each cluster, two HST observing epochs were staggered by about a month, enabling us to discover 11 supernovae, including 3 lensed supernovae, which we followed up with 20 orbits from our program. Reduced HST images, catalogs, and lens models are available on MAST, and reduced Spitzer images are available on IRSA.

N2  - We report the spectroscopic confirmation and modeling of the quadruply imaged quasar GRAL 113100-441959, the first gravitational lens (GL) to be discovered from a machine learning technique that only relies on the relative positions and fluxes of the observed images without considering colour informations. Follow-up spectra obtained with Keck/LRIS reveal the lensing nature of this quadruply imaged quasar with redshift z<SUB>s</SUB> = 1.090 ± 0.002, but show no evidence of the central lens galaxy. Using the image positions and G-band flux ratios provided by Gaia Data Release 2 as constraints, we modeled the system with a singular power-law elliptical mass distribution (SPEMD) plus external shear, to different levels of complexity. We show that relaxing the isothermal constraint of the SPEMD does not lead to statistically significant different results in terms of fitting the lensing data. We thus simplified the SPEMD to a singular isothermal ellipsoid to estimate the Einstein radius of the main lens galaxy θ<SUB>E</SUB> = 0.″851, the intensity and position angle of the external shear (γ,θ<SUB>γ</SUB>) = (0.044, 11.°5), and we predict the lensing galaxy position to be (θ<SUB>gal,1</SUB>, θ<SUB>gal,2</SUB>) = (-0.″424, -0.″744) with respect to image A. We provide time delay predictions for pairs of images, assuming a plausible range of lens redshift values z<SUB>l</SUB> between 0.5 and 0.9. Finally, we examine the impact on time delays of the so-called source position transformation, a family of degeneracies existing between different mass density profiles that reproduce most of the lensing observables equally well. We show that this effect contributes significantly to the time delay error budget and cannot be ignored during the modeling. This has implications for robust cosmography applications of lensed systems. GRAL 113100-441959 is the first in a series of seven new spectroscopically confirmed GLs discovered from Gaia Data Release 2.

N2  - Strongly lensed supernovae (SNe) can be detected as multiply imaged or highly magnified transients. In order to compare the performances of these two observational strategies, we calculate expected discovery rates as a function of survey depth in five grizy filters and for different classes of SNe (types Ia, IIP, IIL, Ibc, and IIn). We find that detections via magnification is the only effective strategy for relatively shallow pre-LSST (Large Synoptic Sky Survey) surveys. For survey depths about the LSST capacity, both strategies yield comparable numbers of lensed SNe. SN samples from the two methods are to a large extent independent and combining them increases detection rates by about 50 per cent. While the number of lensed SNe detectable via magnification saturates at the limiting magnitudes of LSST, detection rates of multiply imaged SN still go up drastically at increasing survey depth. Comparing potential discovery spaces, we find that lensed SNe found via image multiplicity exhibit longer time delays and larger image separations making them more suitable for cosmological constraints than their counterparts found via magnification. We provide useful fitting functions approximating the computed discovery rates for different SN classes and detection methods. We find that the Zwicky Transient Factory will find about two type Ia and four core-collapse lensed SNe per year at a limiting magnitude of 20.6 in the r band. Applying a hybrid method which combines searching for highly magnified or multiply imaged transients, we find that LSST will detect 89 type Ia and 254 core-collapse lensed SNe per year. In all cases, lensed core-collapsed SNe will be dominated by type IIn SNe contributing to 80 per cent of the total counts, although this prediction relies quite strongly on the adopted spectral templates for this class of SNe. Revisiting the case of the lensed SN iPTF16geu, we find that it is consistent within the 2σ contours of predicted redshifts and magnifications for the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory survey.

N2  - Supernovae that are strongly gravitationally lensed (gLSNe) by elliptical galaxies are powerful probes of astrophysics and cosmology that will be discovered systematically by wide-field, high-cadence imaging surveys such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). Here we use pixel-level simulations that include observing strategy, target selection, supernova properties, and dust to forecast the rates and properties of gLSNe that ZTF and LSST will find. Applying the resolution-insensitive discovery strategy of Goldstein et al., we forecast that ZTF (LSST) can discover 0.02 (0.79) 91bg-like, 0.17 (5.92) 91T-like, 1.22 (47.84) Type Ia, 2.76 (88.51) Type IIP, 0.31 (12.78) Type IIL, and 0.36 (15.43) Type Ib/c gLSNe per year, with uncertainties dominated by uncertainties in the supernova rate. We also forecast that the surveys can discover at least 3.75 (209.32) Type IIn gLSNe per year, for a total of at least 8.60 (380.60) gLSNe per year under fiducial observing strategies. ZTF gLSNe have a median z <SUB> s </SUB> = 0.9, z <SUB> l </SUB> = 0.35, | {μ }<SUB>tot</SUB>}| =30, Δt <SUB>max</SUB> = 10 days, min(θ) = 0.″25, and N <SUB>img</SUB> = 4. LSST gLSNe are less compact and less magnified, with a median z <SUB> s </SUB> = 1.0, z <SUB> l </SUB> = 0.4, | {μ }<SUB>tot</SUB>}| =6, Δt <SUB>max</SUB> = 25 days, min(θ) = 0.″6, and N <SUB>img</SUB> = 2. We develop a model of the supernova-host galaxy connection and find that the vast majority of gLSN host galaxies will be multiply imaged, enabling detailed constraints on lens models with sufficiently deep high-resolution imaging taken after the supernova has faded. We release the results of our simulations as catalogs at <A href="http://portal.nersc.gov/project/astro250/glsne/">http://portal.nersc.gov/project/astro250/glsne/</A>.

N2  - We search Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 3 imaging for galaxy-galaxy strong gravitational lenses using convolutional neural networks, extending previous work with new training sets and covering a wider range of redshifts and colors. We train two neural networks using images of simulated lenses, then use them to score postage-stamp images of 7.9 million sources from DES chosen to have plausible lens colors based on simulations. We examine 1175 of the highest-scored candidates and identify 152 probable or definite lenses. Examining an additional 20,000 images with lower scores, we identify a further 247 probable or definite candidates. After including 86 candidates discovered in earlier searches using neural networks and 26 candidates discovered through visual inspection of blue-near-red objects in the DES catalog, we present a catalog of 511 lens candidates.

N2  - We present results of a systematic search for gravitationally lensed quasars in Pan-STARRS1. Our final sample of candidates comprises of 91 systems, not including 25 rediscovered lensed quasars and quasar pairs. In the absence of spectroscopy to verify the lensing nature of the candidates, the main sources of contaminants are likely to be quasar pairs, which we consider to be a byproduct of our work, and a smaller number of quasar + star associations. Among the independently discovered quads is 2M1134-2103, for which we obtained spectroscopy for the first time, finding a redshift of 2.77 for the quasar. There is evidence for microlensing in at least one image. We perform detailed mass modelling of this system using archival imaging data, and find that the unusually large shear responsible for the diamond-like configuration can be attributed mainly to a faint companion ∼4 arcsec away, and to a galaxy group/cluster ∼30 arcsec away. We also set limits of z ∼ 0.5-1.5 on the redshift of the lensing galaxy, based on its brightness, the image separation of the lensed images, and an analysis of the observed photometric flux ratios.

N2  - Follow-up observations of (sub-)mm-selected gravitationally lensed systems have allowed a more detailed study of the dust-enshrouded phase of star formation up to very early cosmic times. Here, the case of the gravitationally lensed merger in HATLAS J142935.3-002836 (also known as H1429-0028; z<SUB>lens</SUB> = 0.218, z<SUB>bkg</SUB> = 1.027) is revisited following recent developments in the literature and new Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) observations targeting two carbon monoxide (CO) rotational transitions J<SUB>up</SUB> = 3 and 6. We show that the line profiles comprise three distinct velocity components, where the fainter high velocity one is less magnified and more compact. The modelling of the observed spectral line energy distribution of CO J<SUB>up</SUB> = 2-6 and [C I] <SUP>3</SUP>P<SUB>1</SUB>-<SUP>3</SUP>P<SUB>0</SUB> assumes a large velocity gradient scenario, where the analysis is based on four statistical approaches. Since the detected gas and dust emission comes exclusively from only one of the two merging components (the one oriented north-south, NS), we are only able to determine upper limits for the companion. The molecular gas in the NS component in H1429-0028 is found to have a temperature of ∼70 K, a volume density of log (n[cm<SUP>-3</SUP>]) ∼ 3.7, to be expanding at ∼10 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> pc<SUP>-1</SUP>, and amounts to {M_H_2 = 4_{-2}^{+3} × 10^9 M_⊙}. The CO to H<SUB>2</SUB> conversion factor is estimated to be α _CO = 0.4_{-0.2}^{+0.3} M<SUB>⊙</SUB>/(K km s<SUP>-1</SUP> pc<SUP>2</SUP>). The NS galaxy is expected to have a factor of ≳10× more gas than its companion ({M_H_2}≲ 3× 10^8 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>). Nevertheless, the total amount of molecular gas in the system comprises only up to 15 per cent (1σ upper limit) of the total (dynamical) mass.

N2  - We present observations of two strong-lensing galaxy clusters located within the 90 per cent credible sky localization maps released following LIGO-Virgo's discovery of the binary black hole (BH-BH) gravitational wave (GW) source GW170814. Our objectives were (1) to search for candidate electromagnetic (EM) counterparts to GW170814 under the hypothesis that it was strongly lensed, and thus more distant and less massive than inferred by LIGO-Virgo, and (2) to demonstrate the feasibility of rapid target of opportunity observations to search for faint lensed transient point sources in crowded cluster cores located within GW sky localizations. Commencing 20 h after discovery, and continuing over 12 nights, we observed Abell 3084 (z = 0.22) and SMACS J0304.3 - 4401 (z = 0.46) with GMOS on the Gemini-South telescope, and Abell 3084 with MUSE on ESO's Very Large Telescope. We detect no candidate EM counterparts in these data. Calibration of our photometric analysis methods using simulations yields 5σ detection limits for transients in difference images of the cores of these clusters of i = 25. This is the most sensitive photometric search to date for counterparts to GW sources, and rules out the possibility that GW170814 was lensed by these clusters with a kilonova-like EM counterpart. Based on the detector frame masses of the compact objects, and assuming that at least one neutron star (NS) is required in the merging system to produce a kilonova-like counterpart, implies that GW170814 was neither an NS-NS nor NS-BH merger at z > 8 lensed by either of these clusters. Also, in the first ever emission line search for counterparts to GW sources, we detected no lines down to a 5σ detection limit of 5× 10^{-17} {erg s^{-1} cm^{-2}}.

N2  - Quadruply lensed quasars are extremely rare objects, but incredibly powerful cosmological tools. Only few dozen are known in the whole sky. Here we present the spectroscopic confirmation of two new quadruplets WG0214-2105 and WG2100-4452 discovered by Agnello & Spiniello (2018) within the Dark Energy Survey public footprints. We have conducted spectroscopic follow-up of these systems with the Southern African Large Telescope as part of a program that aims at confirming the largest possible number of strong gravitational lenses in the equatorial and Southern hemisphere. For both systems, we present the sources spectra that allowed us to estimate their redshifts and unambiguously confirm their lensing nature. For the brighter deflector (WG2100-4452) we measure the spectroscopic redshift and the stellar velocity dispersion from optical absorption lines in the spectrum. For the other system we infer the lens redshift from photometry, being the quality of the spectra not good enough. We obtain photometry for both lenses, directly from multiband images, isolating the lenses from the quasars. One of the quadruplets, WG0214-2105, was also observed by Pan-STARRS, allowing us to estimate the apparent brightness of each quasar image at two different epochs, and thus to find evidence for flux variability. This result could suggest a microlensing event for the faintest components, although intrinsic variability cannot be excluded with only two epochs. Finally, we present simple lens models for both quadruplets, obtaining Einstein radii, singular isothermal ellipsoid velocity dispersions, ellipticities, and position angles of the lenses, as well as time-delay predictions assuming a concordance cosmological model.

N2  - Recently, there have been two landmark discoveries of gravitationally lensed supernovae: the first multiply imaged SN, “Refsdal”, and the first Type Ia SN resolved into multiple images, SN iPTF16geu. Fitting the multiple light curves of such objects can deliver measurements of the lensing time delays, which are the difference in arrival times for the separate images. These measurements provide precise tests of lens models or constraints on the Hubble constant and other cosmological parameters that are independent of the local distance ladder. Over the next decade, accurate time delay measurements will be needed for the tens to hundreds of lensed SNe to be found by wide-field time-domain surveys such as LSST and WFIRST. We have developed an open-source software package for simulations and time delay measurements of multiply imaged SNe, including an improved characterization of the uncertainty caused by microlensing. Using this package, we describe simulations that suggest that a before-peak detection of the leading image enables a more accurate and precise time delay measurement (by ∼1 and ∼2 days, respectively), when compared to an after-peak detection. We also conclude that fitting the effects of microlensing without an accurate prior often leads to biases in the time delay measurement and over-fitting to the data, but that employing a Gaussian Process Regression technique is sufficient for determining the uncertainty due to microlensing.

N2  - We search Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 3 imaging data for galaxy-galaxy strong gravitational lenses using convolutional neural networks. We generate 250 000 simulated lenses at redshifts > 0.8 from which we create a data set for training the neural networks with realistic seeing, sky and shot noise. Using the simulations as a guide, we build a catalogue of 1.1 million DES sources with 1.8 < g - i < 5, 0.6 < g - r < 3, r_mag > 19, g_mag > 20, and i_mag > 18.2. We train two ensembles of neural networks on training sets consisting of simulated lenses, simulated non-lenses, and real sources. We use the neural networks to score images of each of the sources in our catalogue with a value from 0 to 1, and select those with scores greater than a chosen threshold for visual inspection, resulting in a candidate set of 7301 galaxies. During visual inspection, we rate 84 as `probably' or `definitely' lenses. Four of these are previously known lenses or lens candidates. We inspect a further 9428 candidates with a different score threshold, and identify four new candidates. We present 84 new strong lens candidates, selected after a few hours of visual inspection by astronomers. This catalogue contains a comparable number of high-redshift lenses to that predicted by simulations. Based on simulations, we estimate our sample to contain most discoverable lenses in this imaging and at this redshift range.

N2  - We present a new sample of galaxy-scale strong gravitational lens candidates, selected from 904 deg<SUP>2</SUP> of Data Release 4 of the Kilo-Degree Survey, i.e. the `Lenses in the Kilo-Degree Survey' (LinKS) sample. We apply two convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) to {∼ }88 000 colour-magnitude-selected luminous red galaxies yielding a list of 3500 strong lens candidates. This list is further downselected via human inspection. The resulting LinKS sample is composed of 1983 rank-ordered targets classified as `potential lens candidates' by at least one inspector. Of these, a high-grade subsample of 89 targets is identified with potential strong lenses by all inspectors. Additionally, we present a collection of another 200 strong lens candidates discovered serendipitously from various previous ConvNet runs. A straightforward application of our procedure to future Euclid or Large Synoptic Survey Telescope data can select a sample of ∼3000 lens candidates with less than 10 per cent expected false positives and requiring minimal human intervention.

N2  - We present r-band photometric monitoring of the two images, A and B, of the gravitationally lensed quasar SDSS J1442+4055 using the Liverpool Telescope (LT). From the LT light curves between 2015 December and 2018 August, we derive at once a time delay of 25.0 ± 1.5 days (1σ confidence interval; A is leading) and microlensing magnification gradients below 10<SUP>-4</SUP> mag day<SUP>-1</SUP>. The delay interval is not expected to be affected by an appreciable microlensing-induced bias, so it can be used to estimate cosmological parameters. This paper also focuses on new Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) and LT spectroscopic observations of the lens system. We determine the redshift of two bright galaxies around the doubly imaged quasar using LT spectroscopy, while GTC data lead to low-noise individual spectra of A, B, and the main lensing galaxy, G1. The G1 spectral shape is accurately matched to an early-type galaxy template at z = 0.284, and it has potential for further relevant studies. Additionally, the quasar spectra show absorption by metal-rich gas at z ∼ 2. This dusty absorber is responsible for an extinction bump at a rest-frame wavelength of 2209 ± 2 Å, which has strengths of ∼0.47 and 0.76 mag μm<SUP>-1</SUP> for A and B, respectively. In such an intervening system, the dust-to-gas ratio, gas-phase metallicity indicator [Zn/H], and dust depletion level [Fe/Zn] are relatively high.

N2  - We report the study of an “Einstein Cross” configuration first identified in a set of HST images by Cerny et al. Deep spectroscopic observations obtained at the Spanish 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias telescope, allowed us to demonstrate the lens nature of the system, that consists of a Lyman-break galaxy (LBG), not a quasi-stellar object as is usually the case, at z = 3.03 lensed by a galaxy at z = 0.556. Combining the new spectroscopy with the archival HST data, it turns out that the lens is an elliptical galaxy with M <SUB> V </SUB> = -21.0, effective radius 2.8 kpc, and stellar velocity dispersion σ = 208 ± 39 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. The source is an LBG with Lyα luminosity ∼L* at that redshift. From the modeling of the system, performed by assuming a singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) with external shear, we estimate that the flux source is magnified about 4.5 times, and the velocity dispersion of the lens is {σ }<SUB>SIE</SUB>}={197.9}<SUB>-1.3</SUB><SUP>+2.6</SUP> km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, in good agreement with the value derived spectroscopically. This is the second case known of an Einstein cross of an LBG.

N2  - Strong-gravitational lens systems with quadruply imaged quasars (quads) are unique probes to address several fundamental problems in cosmology and astrophysics. Although they are intrinsically very rare, ongoing and planned wide-field deep-sky surveys are set to discover thousands of such systems in the next decade. It is thus paramount to devise a general framework to model strong-lens systems to cope with this large influx without being limited by expert investigator time. We propose such a general modelling framework (implemented with the publicly available software LENSTRONOMY) and apply it to uniformly model three-band Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 images of 13 quads. This is the largest uniformly modelled sample of quads to date and paves the way for a variety of studies. To illustrate the scientific content of the sample, we investigate the alignment between the mass and light distribution in the deflectors. The position angles of these distributions are well-aligned, except when there is strong external shear. However, we find no correlation between the ellipticity of the light and mass distributions. We also show that the observed flux-ratios between the images depart significantly from the predictions of simple smooth models. The departures are strongest in the bluest band, consistent with microlensing being the dominant cause in addition to millilensing. Future papers will exploit this rich data set in combination with ground-based spectroscopy and time delays to determine quantities such as the Hubble constant, the free streaming length of dark matter, and the normalization of the initial stellar mass function.

N2  - We report the discovery and spectroscopic confirmation of 22 new gravitationally lensed quasars found using Gaia data release 2. The selection was made using several techniques: multiple Gaia detections around objects in quasar candidate catalogues, modelling of unWISE coadd pixels using Gaia astrometry, and Gaia detections offset from photometric and spectroscopic galaxies. Spectra of 33 candidates were obtained with the William Herschel Telescope, 22 of which are lensed quasars, two highly probably lensed quasars, five nearly identical quasar pairs, one inconclusive system, and three contaminants. Of the three confirmed quadruply imaged systems, J2145+6345 is a 2.1 arcsec separation quad with four bright images (G = 16.86, 17.26, 18.34, 18.56), making it ideal for time delay monitoring. Analysing this new sample alongside known lenses in the Pan-STARRS footprint, and comparing to expected numbers of lenses, we show that, as expected, we are biased towards systems with bright lensing galaxies and low source redshifts. We discuss possible techniques to remove this bias from future searches. A |b| > 20 complete sample of lensed quasars detected by Gaia and with image separations above 1 arcsec will provide a valuable statistical sample of around 350 systems. Currently only 96 known lenses satisfy these criteria, yet promisingly, our unWISE modelling technique is able to recover all of these with simple WISE-Gaia colour cuts that remove ∼80 per cent of previously followed-up contaminants. Finally, we provide an online data base of known lenses, quasar pairs, and contaminant systems.

N2  - Gravitationally lensed quasars are valuable, but extremely rare, probes of observational cosmology and extragalactic astrophysics. Progress in these fields has been limited just by the paucity of systems with good ancillary data. Here we present a first spectroscopic confirmation of lenses discovered in the Southern Sky from the DES and KiDS-DR3 footprints. We have targeted seven high-graded candidates, selected with new techniques, with NTT-EFOSC2, and confirmed five of them. We provide source spectroscopic redshifts, image separations, gri photometry, and first lens model parameters. The success rate of {∼ } 70{{ per cent}} confirms our forecasts, based on the comparison between the number of candidate doubles and quadruplets in our searches over a ≈5000 deg<SUP>2</SUP> footprint and theoretical predictions.

N2  - <BR /> Aims: In this work, we aim to provide a reliable list of gravitational lens candidates based on a search performed over the entire Gaia Data Release 2 (Gaia DR2). We also aim to show that the astrometric and photometric information coming from the Gaia satellite yield sufficient insights for supervised learning methods to automatically identify strong gravitational lens candidates with an efficiency that is comparable to methods based on image processing. <BR /> Methods: We simulated 106 623 188 lens systems composed of more than two images, based on a regular grid of parameters characterizing a non-singular isothermal ellipsoid lens model in the presence of an external shear. These simulations are used as an input for training and testing our supervised learning models consisting of extremely randomized trees (ERTs). These trees are finally used to assign to each of the 2 129 659 clusters of celestial objects extracted from the Gaia DR2 a discriminant value that reflects the ability of our simulations to match the observed relative positions and fluxes from each cluster. Once complemented with additional constraints, these discriminant values allow us to identify strong gravitational lens candidates out of the list of clusters. <BR /> Results: We report the discovery of 15 new quadruply-imaged lens candidates with angular separations of less than 6″ and assess the performance of our approach by recovering 12 of the 13 known quadruply-imaged systems with all their components detected in Gaia DR2 with a misclassification rate of fortuitous clusters of stars as lens systems that is below 1%. Similarly, the identification capability of our method regarding quadruply-imaged systems where three images are detected in Gaia DR2 is assessed by recovering 10 of the 13 known quadruply-imaged systems having one of their constituting images discarded. The associated misclassification rate varies between 5.83% and 20%, depending on the image we decided to remove. <P />The catalogue of clusters of Gaia DR2 sources from Gaia GraL is only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A> (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via <A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/622/A165">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/622/A165</A>

N2  - We present a novel pilot search for gravitational lenses in the mJIVE-20 survey, which observed 24 903 radio sources selected from Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty cm (FIRST) with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) at an angular resolution of 5 mas. We have taken the visibility data for an initial 3640 sources that were detected by the mJIVE-20 observations and re-mapped them to make wide-field images, selecting 14 sources that had multiple components separated by ≥100 mas, with a flux ratio of ≤15:1 and a surface brightness consistent with gravitational lensing. Two of these candidates are re-discoveries of gravitational lenses found as part of the Cosmic Lens All-Sky Survey (CLASS). The remaining 12 candidates were then re-observed at 1.4 GHz and then simultaneously at 4.1 and 7.1 GHz with the VLBA to measure the spectral index and surface brightness of the individual components as a function of frequency. Ten were rejected as core-jet or core-hotspot(s) systems, with surface brightness distributions and/or spectral indices inconsistent with gravitational lensing, and one was rejected after lens modelling demonstrated that the candidate lensed images failed the parity test. The final lens candidate has an image configuration that is consistent with a simple lens mass model, although further observations are required to confirm the lensing nature. Given the two confirmed gravitational lenses in the mJIVE-20 sample, we find a robust lensing rate of 1:(318 ± 225) for a statistical sample of 635 radio sources detected on mas-scales, which is consistent with that found for CLASS.

N2  - The discovery of the first strongly lensed (μ ≈ 50) quasar at z > 6 (J0439+1634) represents a breakthrough in our understanding of the early universe. We derive the theoretical consequences of the new discovery. We predict that the observed population of z > 6 quasars should contain many sources with magnifications μ ≲ 10 and with image separations below the resolution threshold. Additionally, current selection criteria could have missed a substantial population of lensed z > 6 quasars, due to the contamination of the drop-out photometric bands by lens galaxies. We argue that this predicted population of lensed z > 6 quasars would be misclassified and mixed up with low-z galaxies. We quantify the fraction of undetected quasars as a function of the slope of the bright end of the quasar luminosity function, β. For β ≲ 3.6, we predict that the undetected lensed quasars could reach half of the population, whereas for β ≳ 4.5 the vast majority of the z > 6 quasar population is lensed and still undetected. This would significantly affect the z > 6 quasar luminosity function and inferred black hole mass distributions, with profound implications for the ultraviolet, X-ray, and infrared cosmic backgrounds and the growth of early quasars.

N2  - Strong gravitational lensing provides a powerful probe of the physical properties of quasars and their host galaxies. A high fraction of the most luminous high-redshift quasars was predicted to be lensed due to magnification bias. However, no multiple imaged quasar was found at z > 5 in previous surveys. We report the discovery of J043947.08+163415.7, a strongly lensed quasar at z = 6.51, the first such object detected at the epoch of reionization, and the brightest quasar yet known at z > 5. High-resolution Hubble Space Telescope imaging reveals a multiple imaged system with a maximum image separation θ ∼ 0.″2, best explained by a model of three quasar images lensed by a low-luminosity galaxy at z ∼ 0.7, with a magnification factor of ∼50. The existence of this source suggests that a significant population of strongly lensed, high-redshift quasars could have been missed by previous surveys, as standard color selection techniques would fail when the quasar color is contaminated by the lensing galaxy.

N2  - More than 100 galaxy-scale strong gravitational lens systems have been found by searching for the emission lines coming from galaxies with redshifts higher than the lens galaxies. Based on this spectroscopic-selection method, we introduce the deep Residual Networks (ResNet; a kind of deep Convolutional Neural Networks) to search for the galaxy-Ly α emitter (LAE) lens candidates by recognizing the Ly α emission lines coming from high- redshift galaxies (2 < z < 3) in the spectra of early-type galaxies (ETGs) at middle redshift (z ∼ 0.5). The spectra of the ETGs come from the Data Release 12 (DR12) of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III). In this paper, we first build a 28 layers ResNet model, and then artificially synthesize 150 000 training spectra, including 140 000 spectra without Ly α lines and 10 000 ones with Ly α lines, to train the networks. After 20 training epochs, we obtain a near-perfect test accuracy at 0.995 4. The corresponding loss is 0.002 8 and the completeness is 93.6 per cent. We finally apply our ResNet model to our predictive data with 174 known lens candidates. We obtain 1232 hits including 161 of the 174 known candidates (92.5 per cent discovery rate). Apart from the hits found in other works, our ResNet model also find 536 new hits. We then perform several subsequent selections on these 536 hits and present five most believable lens candidates.

N2  - Measuring time delays from strongly lensed supernovae (SNe) is emerging as a novel and independent tool for estimating the Hubble constant ( H <SUB>0</SUB>). This is very important given the recent discord in the value of H <SUB>0</SUB>) from two methods that probe different distance ranges. The success of this technique will rely of our ability to discover strongly lensed SNe with measurable time delays. Here, we present the magnifications and the time delays for the multiply-imaged galaxies behind the Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) galaxy clusters, by using recently published lensing models. Continuing on our previous work done for Abell 1689 (A1689) and Abell 370, we also show the prospects of observing strongly lensed SNe behind the HFF clusters with the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). With four 1-hour visits in one year, the summed expectations of all six HFF clusters are 0.5 core-collapse (CC) SNe and 0.06 Type Ia SNe (SNe Ia) in F115W band, while with F150W the expectations are higher, 0.9 CC SNe and 0.06 SNe Ia. These estimates match those expected by only surveying A1689, proving that the performance of A1689 as gravitational telescope is superior. In the five HFF clusters presented here, we find that F150W will be able to detect SNe Ia (SNe IIP) exploding in 93 (80) pairsmultiply-imaged galaxies with time delays of less than 5 years.

N2  - We investigate the local and line-of-sight (LOS) overdensities of strong gravitational lens galaxies using wide-area multiband imaging from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program. We present 41 new definite or probable lens candidates discovered in Data Release 2 of the survey. Using a combined sample of 87 galaxy-scale lenses out to a lens redshift of z <SUB>L</SUB> ∼ 0.8, we compare galaxy number counts in LOSs toward known and newly discovered lenses in the survey to those of a control sample consisting of random LOSs. We also compare the local overdensity of lens galaxies to a sample of “twin” galaxies that have similar redshift and velocity dispersion to test whether lenses lie in different environments from similar nonlens galaxies. We find that lens fields contain higher number counts of galaxies compared to the control fields, but this effect arises from the local environment of the lens. Once galaxies in the lens plane are removed, the lens LOSs are consistent with the control sample. The local environments of the lenses are overdense compared to the control sample, and are slightly overdense compared to those of the twin sample, although the significance is marginal. There is no significant evidence of the evolution of the local overdensity of lens environments with redshift.

N2  - Since their discovery, submillimetre-selected galaxies<SUP>1,2</SUP> have revolutionized the field of galaxy formation and evolution. From the hundreds of square degrees mapped at submillimetre wavelengths<SUP>3-5</SUP>, only a handful of sources have been confirmed to lie at z > 5 (refs <SUP>6-10</SUP>) and only two at z ≥ 6 (refs <SUP>11,12</SUP>). All of these submillimetre galaxies are rare examples of extreme starburst galaxies with star formation rates of ≳1,000 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> and therefore are not representative of the general population of dusty star-forming galaxies. Consequently, our understanding of the nature of these sources, at the earliest epochs, is still incomplete. Here, we report the spectroscopic identification of a gravitationally amplified (μ = 9.3 ± 1.0) dusty star-forming galaxy at z = 6.027. After correcting for gravitational lensing, we derive an intrinsic less-extreme star formation rate of 380 ± 50 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> for this source and find that its gas and dust properties are similar to those measured for local ultra luminous infrared galaxies, extending the local trends to a poorly explored territory in the early Universe. The star-formation efficiency of this galaxy is similar to those measured in its local analogues<SUP>13</SUP>, despite a 12 Gyr difference in cosmic time.

N2  - We report the discovery of SDSS J0909+4449, an exceptional system consisting of a quasar at z = 2.788 strongly lensed by a group of galaxies at z ∼ 0.9 into three images separated by up to 14 arcsec based on archival data collected by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, Beijing-Arizona Sky Survey, the Mayall z-band Legacy Survey, and the Gemini Telescope. We discuss two hypotheses on the nature of SDSS J0909+4449, i.e. a rare triply imaged quasar in the naked cusp configuration and a typical quadruply imaged quasar with the fourth image undetected in this data. We find that simple lens models can provide excellent fits to the observed image positions and the non-detection under either hypothesis. Deeper imaging data, spectroscopic observations, and follow-up light-curve measurements will be helpful in determining which hypothesis is correct and provide better constraints on the lens mass distribution. Nevertheless, given its unusually large image separations, SDSS J0909+4449 will be a unique probe for the mass structure and the underlying cooling and stellar feedback processes on group or cluster scales.

N2  - The primary goals of the STRong lensing Insights into the Dark Energy Survey (STRIDES) collaboration are to measure the dark energy equation of state parameter and the free streaming length of dark matter. To this aim, STRIDES is discovering strongly lensed quasars in the imaging data of the Dark Energy Survey and following them up to measure time delays, high resolution imaging, and spectroscopy sufficient to construct accurate lens models. In this paper, we first present forecasts for STRIDES. Then, we describe the STRIDES classification scheme, and give an overview of the Fall 2016 follow-up campaign. We continue by detailing the results of two selection methods, the outlier selection technique and a morphological algorithm, and presenting lens models of a system that could possibly be a lensed quasar in an unusual configuration. We conclude with the summary statistics of the Fall 2016 campaign. Including searches presented in companion papers (Anguita et al.; Ostrovski et al.), STRIDES followed up 117 targets identifying 7 new strongly lensed systems, and 7 nearly identical quasars, which could be confirmed as lenses by the detection of the lens galaxy. 76 candidates were rejected and 27 remain otherwise inconclusive, for a success rate in the range of 6-35 per cent. This rate is comparable to that of previous searches like SDSS Quasar Lens Search even though the parent data set of STRIDES is purely photometric and our selection of candidates cannot rely on spectroscopic information.

N2  - Fossil galaxy systems have been described as some of the oldest systems in the universe, where the central galaxy has cannibalized most nearby member galaxies over cosmic time. While the progenitors to fossil systems have been predicted to exist in numerical simulations, little effort has gone into locating them until now. The discovery of fossil progenitors in the CASSOWARY catalog of strong gravitational lensing demonstrates that not all fossils are old, and their formation histories are more complex than originally thought. These progenitors have optical characteristics consistent with them being the transition phase between non-fossils and fossils, as we are observing the central galaxies in mid-assembly. We also identify a bias where systems acting as strong gravitational lenses are ∼5 times more likely to be seen as fossils than non-lensing systems. Chandra X-ray images of eight CASSOWARY fossil progenitors show them being significantly over-luminous and hotter than comparable non-fossils which could be due to the strong lensing bias in our data, or fossils have characteristically deeper potential wells than non-fossils. Two progenitors were luminous enough to see a rise in gas temperature toward their cores which suggests these may be undergoing group mergers akin to the previously studied progenitor CSWA 2 verifying this as a viable fossil formation mechanism. Refinements to our original CASSOWARY data using the Hubble Space Telescope allowed us to disentangle complex merging environments at the centers of these eight progenitors, which further solidified the notion that progenitors are indeed transitioning toward fossil systems.

N2  - We present the discovery and measurements of a gravitationally lensed supernova (SN) behind the galaxy cluster MOO J1014+0038. Based on multi-band Hubble Space Telescope and Very Large Telescope (VLT) photometry of the supernova, and VLT spectroscopy of the host galaxy, we find a 97.5% probability that this SN is a SN Ia, and a 2.5% chance of a CC SN. Our typing algorithm combines the shape and color of the light curve with the expected rates of each SN type in the host galaxy. With a redshift of 2.2216, this is the highest redshift SN Ia discovered with a spectroscopic host-galaxy redshift. A further distinguishing feature is that the lensing cluster, at redshift 1.23, is the most distant to date to have an amplified SN. The SN lies in the middle of the color and light-curve shape distributions found at lower redshift, disfavoring strong evolution to z = 2.22. We estimate an amplification due to gravitational lensing of {2.8}<SUB>-0.5</SUB><SUP>+0.6</SUP> (1.10 ± 0.23 mag)—compatible with the value estimated from the weak-lensing-derived mass and the mass-concentration relation from ΛCDM simulations—making it the most amplified SN Ia discovered behind a galaxy cluster.

N2  - We report the discovery, spectroscopic confirmation, and first lens models of the first, strongly lensed quasars from a combined search in WISE and Gaia-DR1 over the DES footprint. Their Einstein radii span a range between ≈2.0 arcsec and ≈0.4 arcsec. Two of these (WGD2038-4008, RA = 20:38:02.65, Dec. = -40:08:14.64; WGD2021-4115, RA = 20:21:39.45, Dec. = -41:15:57.11) also have confirmed deflector redshifts. The four-image lens WGD2038-4008, with source and deflector redshifts <SUB>s</SUB> = 0.777 ± 0.001 and z<SUB>l</SUB> = 0.230 ± 0.002, respectively, has a deflector with radius R<SUB>eff</SUB> ≈ 3.4 arcsec, stellar mass log (M_{⋆}/M_{⊙})=11.64^{+0.20}_{-0.43}, and extended isophotal shape variation. Simple lens models yield Einstein radii R<SUB>E</SUB> = (1.30 ± 0.04) arcsec, axis ratio q = 0.75 ± 0.1 (compatible with that of the starlight) and considerable shear-ellipticity degeneracies. The two-image lens WGD2021-4115 has z<SUB>s</SUB> = 1.390 ± 0.001 and z<SUB>l</SUB> = 0.335 ± 0.002, and Einstein radius R<SUB>E</SUB> = (1.1 ± 0.1) arcsec, but higher-resolution imaging is needed to accurately separate the deflector and faint quasar image. Analogous lens model degeneracies hold for the other six lenses (J0146-1133, J0150-4041, J0235-2433, J0245-0556, J0259-2338, and J0508-2748) shown in this paper.

N2  - We present new Hubble Space Telescope WFC3 imaging of four gravitationally lensed quasars: MG 0414+0534; RXJ 0911+0551; B 1422+231; WFI J2026-4536. In three of these systems we detect wavelength-dependent microlensing, which we use to place constraints on the sizes and temperature profiles of the accretion discs in each quasar. Accretion disc radius is assumed to vary with wavelength according to the power-law relationship r ∝ λ<SUP>p</SUP>, equivalent to a radial temperature profile of T ∝ r<SUP>-1/p</SUP>. The goal of this work is to search for deviations from standard thin disc theory, which predicts that radius goes as wavelength to the power p = 4/3. We find a wide range of power-law indices, from p=1.4^{+0.5}_{-0.4} in B 1422+231to p=2.3^{+0.5}_{-0.4} in WFI J2026-4536. The measured value of p appears to correlate with the strength of the wavelength-dependent microlensing. We explore this issue with mock simulations using a fixed accretion disc with p = 1.5, and find that cases where wavelength-dependent microlensing is small tend to underestimate the value of p. This casts doubt on previous ensemble single-epoch measurements which have favoured low values using samples of lensed quasars that display only moderate chromatic effects. Using only our systems with strong chromatic microlensing we prefer p > 4/3, corresponding to shallower temperature profiles than expected from standard thin disc theory.

N2  - Context. Thanks to its spatial resolution, the ESA/Gaia space mission offers a unique opportunity to discover new multiply imaged quasars and to study the already known lensed systems at sub-milliarcsecond astrometric precisions. <BR /> Aims: In this paper, we address the detection of the known multiply imaged quasars from the Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) and determine the astrometric and photometric properties of the individually detected images found in the Gaia DR2 catalogue. <BR /> Methods: We have compiled an exhaustive list of quasar gravitational lenses from the literature to search for counterparts in the Gaia DR2. We then analysed the astrometric and photometric properties of these Gaia's detections. To highlight the tremendous potential of Gaia at the sub-milliarcsecond level we finally performed a simple Bayesian modelling of the well-known gravitational lens system HE0435-1223, using Gaia DR2 and HST astrometry. <BR /> Results: From 481 known multiply imaged quasars, 206 have at least one image found in the Gaia DR2. Among the 44 known quadruply imaged quasars of the list, 29 have at least one image in the Gaia DR2, 12 of which are fully detected (2MASX J01471020+4630433, HE 0435-1223, SDSS1004+4112, PG1115+080, RXJ1131-1231, 2MASS J11344050-2103230, 2MASS J13102005-1714579, B1422+231, J1606-2333, J1721+8842, WFI2033-4723, WGD2038-4008), eight have three counterparts, eight have two and one has only one. As expected, the modelling of HE0435-1223 shows that the model parameters are significantly better constrained when using Gaia astrometry compared to HST astrometry, in particular the relative positions of the background quasar source and the centroid of the deflector. The Gaia sub-milliarcsecond astrometry also significantly reduces the parameter correlations. <BR /> Conclusions: Besides providing an up-to-date list of multiply imaged quasars and their detection in the Gaia DR2, this paper shows that more complex modelling scenarios will certainly benefit from Gaia sub-milliarcsecond astrometry. <P />The table of lenses (confirmed and candidates, detected or not in Gaia DR2) is only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A> (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via <A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/618/A56">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/618/A56</A>.

N2  - We report the discovery, spectroscopic confirmation, and preliminary characterization of 24 gravitationally lensed quasars identified using Gaia observations. Candidates were selected in the Pan-STARRS footprint with quasar-like WISE colours or as photometric quasars from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), requiring either multiple detections in Gaia or a single Gaia detection near a morphological galaxy. The Pan-STARRS grizY images were modelled for the most promising candidates and 60 candidate systems were followed up with the William Herschel Telescope. 13 of the lenses were discovered as Gaia multiples and 10 as single Gaia detections near galaxies. We also discover 1 lens identified through a quasar emission line in an SDSS galaxy spectrum. The lenses have median image separation 2.13 arcsec and the source redshifts range from 1.06 to 3.36. 4 systems are quadruply imaged and 20 are doubly imaged. Deep CFHT data reveal an Einstein ring in one double system. We also report 12 quasar pairs, 10 of which have components at the same redshift and require further follow-up to rule out the lensing hypothesis. We compare the properties of these lenses and other known lenses recovered by our search method to a complete sample of simulated lenses to show the lenses we are missing are mainly those with small separations and higher source redshifts. The initial Gaia data release only catalogues all images of ∼30 per cent of known bright lensed quasars, however the improved completeness of Gaia data release 2 will help find all bright lensed quasars on the sky.

N2  - 2MASX J04035024-0239275 is a bright red elliptical galaxy at redshift 0.0661 that presents two extended sources at 2″ to the north-east and 1″ to the south-west. The sizes and surface brightnesses of the two blue sources are consistent with a gravitationally-lensed background galaxy. In this paper, we present Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) observations of this galaxy from the All-weather MUse Supernova Integral-field Nearby Galaxies (AMUSING) survey, and report the discovery of a background lensed galaxy at redshift 0.1915, together with other 15 background galaxies at redshifts ranging from 0.09 to 0.9, that are not multiply imaged. We have extracted aperture spectra of the lens and all the sources and fit the stellar continuum with STARLIGHT to estimate their stellar and emission line properties. A trace of past merger and active nucleus activity is found in the lensing galaxy, while the background lensed galaxy is found to be star-forming. Modelling the lensing potential with a singular isothermal ellipsoid, we find an Einstein radius of 1{^''<SUB>.</SUB>}45 ± 0{^''<SUB>.</SUB>}04, which corresponds to 1.9 kpc at the redshift of the lens and it is much smaller than its effective radius (r<SUB>eff</SUB> ∼ 9″). Comparing the Einstein mass and the STARLIGHT stellar mass within the same aperture yields a dark matter fraction of 18 per cent ± 8 per cent within the Einstein radius. The advent of large surveys such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will discover a number of strong-lensed systems, and here we demonstrate how wide-field integral field spectroscopy offers an excellent approach to study them and to precisely model lensing effects.

N2  - We present a detailed study of an unusually bright, lensed galaxy at z = 5.424 discovered within the CFHTLS imaging survey. With an observed flux of i<SUB>AB</SUB> = 23.0, J141446.82+544631.9 is one of the brightest galaxies known at z > 5. It is characterized by strong Ly α emission, reaching a peak in (observed) flux density of >10<SUP>-16</SUP>erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>Å<SUP>-1</SUP>. A deep optical spectrum from the Large Binocular Telescope places strong constraints on N V and C IV emission, disfavouring an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) source for the emission. However, a detection of the N IV] λ1486 emission line indicates a hard ionizing continuum, possibly from hot, massive stars. Resolved imaging from HST deblends the galaxy from a foreground interloper; these observations include narrowband imaging of the Ly α emission, which is marginally resolved on approximately few kpc scales and has EW<SUB>0</SUB> ∼ 260 Å. The Ly α emission extends over ∼2000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> and is broadly consistent with expanding shell models. Spectral energy distribution fitting that includes Spitzer/IRAC photometry suggests a complex star formation history that includes both a recent burst and an evolved population. J1414+5446 lies 30 arcsec from the centre of a known lensing cluster in the CFHTLS; combined with the foreground contribution, this leads to a highly uncertain estimate for the lensing magnification in the range 5 ≲ μ ≲ 25. Because of its unusual brightness, J1414+5446 affords unique opportunities for detailed study of an individual galaxy near the epoch of re-ionization and a preview of what can be expected from upcoming wide-area surveys that will yield hundreds of similar objects.

N2  - We propose a new strategy of finding strongly lensed supernovae (SNe) by monitoring known galaxy-scale strong-lens systems. Strongly lensed SNe are potentially powerful tools for the study of cosmology, galaxy evolution, and stellar populations, but they are extremely rare. By targeting known strongly lensed star-forming galaxies, our strategy significantly boosts the detection efficiency for lensed SNe compared to a blind search. As a reference sample, we compile the 128 galaxy-galaxy strong-lens systems from the Sloan Lens ACS Survey (SLACS), the SLACS for the Masses Survey, and the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey Emission-Line Lens Survey. Within this sample, we estimate the rates of strongly lensed Type Ia SN (SNIa) and core-collapse SN (CCSN) to be 1.23 ± 0.12 and 10.4 ± 1.1 events per year, respectively. The lensed SN images are expected to be widely separated with a median separation of 2 arcsec. Assuming a conservative fiducial lensing magnification factor of 5 for the most highly magnified SN image, we forecast that a monitoring program with a single-visit depth of 24.7 mag (5σ point source, r band) and a cadence of 5 days can detect 0.49 strongly lensed SNIa event and 2.1 strongly lensed CCSN events per year within this sample. Our proposed targeted-search strategy is particularly useful for prompt and efficient identifications and follow-up observations of strongly lensed SN candidates. It also allows telescopes with small fields of view and limited time to efficiently discover strongly lensed SNe with a pencil-beam scanning strategy.

N2  - The most distant galaxies known are at z ∼ 10-11, observed 400-500 Myr after the Big Bang. The few z ∼ 10-11 candidates discovered to date have been exceptionally small, barely resolved, if at all, by the Hubble Space Telescope. Here we present the discovery of SPT0615-JD1, a fortuitous z ∼ 10 (z <SUB>phot</SUB> = {9.9}<SUB>-0.6</SUB><SUP>+0.8</SUP>) galaxy candidate stretched into an arc over ∼2.″5 by the effects of strong gravitational lensing. Discovered in the Reionization Lensing Cluster Survey (RELICS) Hubble Treasury program and companion S-RELICS Spitzer program, this candidate has a lensed H-band magnitude of 24.6 ± 0.1 AB mag. With a magnification of μ ∼ 4-7 estimated from our lens models, the delensed intrinsic magnitude is 26.7 ± 0.1 AB mag, and the half-light radius is r <SUB> e </SUB> < 0.8 kpc, both consistent with other z > 9 candidates. The inferred stellar mass ({log}[{M}<SUB>\star </SUB>/{M}<SUB>⊙ </SUB>]={8.3}<SUB>-0.2</SUB><SUP>+0.3</SUP>) and star formation rate ({log}[{SFR}/{M}<SUB>⊙ </SUB> {yr}}<SUP>-1</SUP>]={1.1}<SUB>-0.4</SUB><SUP>+0.5</SUP>) indicate that this candidate is a typical star-forming galaxy on the z > 6 SFR-M <SUB>⋆</SUB> relation. We note that three independent lens models predict two counter images, at least one of which should be of a similar magnitude to the arc, but these counter images are not yet detected. Counter images would not be expected if the arc were at lower redshift. The relatively large physical size could be due to a merger or accretion event, while the unprecedented lensed size of this z ∼ 10 candidate offers the potential for ALMA and the James Webb Space Telescope to study the geometric and kinematic properties of a galaxy observed 500 Myr after the Big Bang.

N2  - We present the detection at 89 μm (observed frame) of the Herschel-selected gravitationally lensed starburst galaxy HATLAS J1429-0028 (also known as G15v2.19) in 15 minutes with the High-resolution Airborne Wideband Camera-plus (HAWC+) onboard the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA). The spectacular lensing system consists of an edge-on foreground disk galaxy at z = 0.22 and a nearly complete Einstein ring of an intrinsic ultra-luminous infrared (IR) galaxy at z = 1.03. Is this high IR luminosity powered by pure star formation (SF) or also an active galactic nucleus (AGN)? Previous nebular line diagnostics indicate that it is star formation dominated. We perform a 27-band multiwavelength spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling including the new SOFIA/HAWC+ data to constrain the fractional AGN contribution to the total IR luminosity. The AGN fraction in the IR turns out to be negligible. In addition, J1429-0028 serves as a testbed for comparing SED results from different models/templates and SED codes (MAGPHYS, SED3FIT, and CIGALE). We stress that star formation history is the dominant source of uncertainty in the derived stellar mass (as high as a factor of ∼10) even in the case of extensive photometric coverage. Furthermore, the detection of a source at z ∼ 1 with SOFIA/HAWC+ demonstrates the potential of utilizing this facility for distant galaxy studies including the decomposition of SF/AGN components, which cannot be accomplished with other current facilities.

N2  - We investigate the effect of microlensing on the standardization of strongly lensed Type Ia supernovae (GLSNe Ia). We present predictions for the amount of scatter induced by microlensing across a range of plausible strong lens macromodels. We find that lensed images in regions of low convergence, shear and stellar density are standardizable, where the microlensing scatter is ≲ 0.15 mag, comparable to the intrinsic dispersion of a typical SN Ia. These standardizable configurations correspond to asymmetric lenses with an image located far outside the Einstein radius of the lens. Symmetric and small Einstein radius lenses (≲ 0.5 arcsec) are not standardizable. We apply our model to the recently discovered GLSN Ia iPTF16geu and find that the large discrepancy between the observed flux and the macromodel predictions from More et al. cannot be explained by microlensing alone. Using the mock GLSNe Ia catalogue of Goldstein et al., we predict that ∼22 per cent of GLSNe Ia discovered by Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will be standardizable, with a median Einstein radius of 0.9 arcsec and a median time delay of 41 d. By breaking the mass-sheet degeneracy the full LSST GLSNe Ia sample will be able to detect systematics in H<SUB>0</SUB> at the 0.5 per cent level.

N2  - We report the discovery of a new low-redshift galaxy-scale gravitational lens, identified from a systematic search of publicly available MUSE observations. The lens galaxy, 2MASXJ04035024-0239275, is a giant elliptical at z= 0.066 04 with a velocity dispersion of σ = 314 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. The lensed source has a redshift of 0.191 65 and forms a pair of bright images on either side of the lens centre. The Einstein radius is 1.5 arcsec, projecting to 1.8 kpc, which is just one quarter of the galaxy effective radius. After correcting for an estimated 19 per cent dark matter contribution, we find that the stellar mass-to-light ratio from lensing is consistent with that expected for a Milky Way initial mass function (IMF). Combining the new system with three previously studied low-redshift lenses of similar σ, the derived mean mass excess factor (relative to a Kroupa IMF) is ⟨α⟩ = 1.09 ± 0.08. With all four systems, the intrinsic scatter in α for massive elliptical galaxies can be limited to <0.32, at 90 per cent confidence.

N2  - Context. Multiply imaged gravitationally lensed quasars are among the most interesting and useful observable extragalactic phenomena. Because their study constitutes a unique tool in various fields of astronomy, they are highly sought, but difficult to find. Even in this era of all-sky surveys, discovering them remains a great challenge, with barely a few hundred systems currently known. <BR /> Aims: We aim to discover new multiply imaged quasar candidates in the recently published Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2), which is the astrometric and photometric all-sky survey with the highest spatial resolution that achieves effective resolutions from 0.4″ to 2.2″. <BR /> Methods: We cross-matched a merged list of quasars and candidates with Gaia DR2 and found 1 839 143 counterparts within 0.5″. We then searched matches with more than two Gaia DR2 counterparts within 6″. We further narrowed the resulting list using astrometry and photometry compatibility criteria between the Gaia DR2 counterparts. A supervised machine-learning method, called extremely randomized trees, was finally adopted to assign a probability of being lensed to each remaining system. <BR /> Results: We report the discovery of two quadruply imaged quasar candidates that are fully detected in Gaia DR2. These are the most promising new quasar lens candidates from Gaia DR2 and a simple singular isothermal ellipsoid lens model is able to reproduce their image positions to within 1 mas. This Letter demonstrates the discovery potential of Gaia for gravitational lenses.

N2  - Galaxy clusters can act as gravitational lenses and magnify the universe behind them, allowing us to see deep into the early universe. The Hubble Space Telescope Frontier Fields program uses six galaxy clusters imaged by Hubble to discover and study galaxies at z ∼ 5-10. Seven independent teams developed lens models and derived magnifications for each galaxy cluster, based on positional and redshift constraints from the best available data at the time. In this work we evaluate 10 models for MACS J0416.1-2403 that were made public in 2015 by contrasting them with new spectroscopic redshifts that were measured in 2016. We developed an independent comparison method that uses the source plane root-mean-square as a metric of lensing model performance. Our analysis quantifies the ability of models to predict unknown multiple images. We examine the source plane scatter of multiply imaged systems and explore the dependence of the scatter on the location and the redshift of the background sources. The analysis we present evaluates the performance of the different algorithms in the specific case of the MACS J0416.1-2403 models.

N2  - We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array measurements of the “Cosmic Seagull,” a strongly magnified galaxy at z = 2.7779 behind the Bullet Cluster. We report CO(3-2) and continuum 344 μm (rest-frame) data at one of the highest differential magnifications ever recorded at submillimeter wavelengths (μ up to ∼50), facilitating a characterization of the kinematics of a rotational curve in great detail (at ∼620 pc resolution in the source plane). We find no evidence for a decreasing rotation curve, from which we derive a dynamical mass of (6.3 ± 0.7) × 10<SUP>10</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> within r = 2.6 ± 0.1 kpc. The discovery of a third, unpredicted, image provides key information for a future improvement of the lensing modeling of the Bullet Cluster and allows a measure of the stellar mass, {1.6}<SUB>-0.86</SUB><SUP>+1.9</SUP>× {10}<SUP>10</SUP> {M}<SUB>⊙ </SUB>, unaffected by strong differential magnification. The baryonic mass is expected to be dominated by the molecular gas content (f <SUB>gas</SUB> ≤ 80 ± 20%) based on an {M}<SUB>{{{H</SUB>}}<SUB>2</SUB>} mass estimated from the difference between dynamical and stellar masses. The star formation rate (SFR) is estimated via the spectral energy distribution (SFR = 190 ± 10 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>), implying a molecular gas depletion time of 0.25 ± 0.08 Gyr.

N2  - We present the discovery of three quasar lenses in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, selected using two novel photometry-based selection techniques. The J0941+0518 system, with two point sources separated by 5.46 arcsec on either side of a galaxy, has source and lens redshifts 1.54 and 0.343. Images of J2257+2349 show two point sources separated by 1.67 arcsec on either side of an E/S0 galaxy. The extracted spectra show two images of the same quasar at z<SUB>s</SUB> = 2.10. SDSS J1640+1045 has two quasar spectra at z<SUB>s</SUB> = 1.70 and fits to the SDSS and Pan-STARRS images confirm the presence of a galaxy between the two point sources. We observed 56 photometrically selected lens candidates in this follow-up campaign, confirming three new lenses, re-discovering one known lens, and ruling out 36 candidates, with 16 still inconclusive. This initial campaign demonstrates the power of purely photometric selection techniques in finding lensed quasars.

N2  - We present Keck Cosmic Web Imager spectroscopy of the four putative images of the lensed quasar candidate J014710+463040 recently discovered by Berghea et al. The data verify the source as a quadruply lensed, broad absorption-line quasar having {z}<SUB>{{S</SUB>}}=2.377 +/- 0.007. We detect intervening absorption in the Fe II λλ2586, 2600, Mg II λλ2796, 2803, and/or C IV λλ1548, 1550 transitions in eight foreground systems, three of which have redshifts consistent with the photometric-redshift estimate reported for the lensing galaxy (z <SUB>L</SUB> ≈ 0.57). The source images probe these absorbers over transverse physical scales of ≈0.3-22 kpc, permitting assessment of the variation in metal-line equivalent width {W}<SUB>{{r</SUB>}} as a function of sight-line separation. We measure differences in {W}<SUB>{{r</SUB>},2796} of <40% across most of the sight-line pairs subtending 8-22 kpc, suggestive of a high degree of spatial coherence for the Mg II-absorbing material. {W}<SUB>{{r</SUB>},2600} varies by >50% over the same scales across the majority of sight-line pairs, while C IV absorption exhibits a wide range in {W}<SUB>{{r</SUB>},1548} differences of ≈5%-80% within transverse distances of ≲3 kpc. These spatial variations are consistent with those measured in intervening absorbers detected toward lensed quasars drawn from the literature, in which {W}<SUB>{{r</SUB>},2796} and {W}<SUB>{{r</SUB>},1548} vary by ≤20% in 35 ± 7% and 47 ± 6% of sight lines separated by <10 kpc, respectively. J014710+463040 is one of only a handful of z > 2 quadruply lensed systems for which all four source images are very bright (r = 15.4-17.7 mag) and are easily separated in ground-based seeing conditions. As such, it is an ideal candidate for higher-resolution spectroscopy probing the spatial variation in the kinematic structure and physical state of intervening absorbers.

N2  - We report the discovery of the ultra-luminous quasi-stellar object SMSS J215728.21-360215.1 with magnitude z = 16.9 and W4 = 7.42 at redshift 4.75. Given absolute magnitudes of M<SUB>145, AB</SUB> = -29.3, M<SUB>300, AB</SUB> = -30.12, and logL<SUB>bol</SUB>/L<SUB>bol, ⊙</SUB> = 14.84, it is the quasi-stellar object with the highest unlensed UV-optical luminosity currently known in the Universe. It was found by combining proper-motion data from Gaia DR2 with photometry from SkyMapper DR1 and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. In the GAIA database, it is an isolated single source and thus unlikely to be strongly gravitationally lensed. It is also unlikely to be a beamed source as it is not discovered in the radio domain by either NRAO-VLA Sky Survey or Sydney University Molonglo Southern Survey. It is classed as a weak-emission-line quasi-stellar object and possesses broad absorption line features. A lightcurve from ATLAS spanning the time from 2015 October to 2017 December shows little sign of variability.

N2  - Strong gravitational lensing by galaxy clusters magnifies background galaxies, enhancing our ability to discover statistically significant samples of galaxies at {\boldsymbol{z}}> 6, in order to constrain the high-redshift galaxy luminosity functions. Here, we present the first five lens models out of the Reionization Lensing Cluster Survey (RELICS) Hubble Treasury Program, based on new HST WFC3/IR and ACS imaging of the clusters RXC J0142.9+4438, Abell 2537, Abell 2163, RXC J2211.7-0349, and ACT-CLJ0102-49151. The derived lensing magnification is essential for estimating the intrinsic properties of high-redshift galaxy candidates, and properly accounting for the survey volume. We report on new spectroscopic redshifts of multiply imaged lensed galaxies behind these clusters, which are used as constraints, and detail our strategy to reduce systematic uncertainties due to lack of spectroscopic information. In addition, we quantify the uncertainty on the lensing magnification due to statistical and systematic errors related to the lens modeling process, and find that in all but one cluster, the magnification is constrained to better than 20% in at least 80% of the field of view, including statistical and systematic uncertainties. The five clusters presented in this paper span the range of masses and redshifts of the clusters in the RELICS program. We find that they exhibit similar strong lensing efficiencies to the clusters targeted by the Hubble Frontier Fields within the WFC3/IR field of view. Outputs of the lens models are made available to the community through the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes.

N2  - Gravitationally lensed quasars are powerful and versatile astrophysical tools, but they are challengingly rare. In particular, only ∼25 well-characterized quadruple systems are known to date. To refine the target catalogue for the forthcoming Taipan Galaxy Survey, the images of a large number of sources are being visually inspected in order to identify objects that are confused by a foreground star or galaxies that have a distinct multicomponent structure. An unexpected by-product of this work has been the serendipitous discovery of about a dozen galaxies that appear to be lensing quasars, i.e. pairs or quartets of foreground stellar objects in close proximity to the target source. Here, we report two diamond-shaped systems. Follow-up spectroscopy with the IMACS instrument on the 6.5m Magellan Baade telescope confirms one of these as a z = 1.975 quasar quadruply lensed by a double galaxy at z = 0.293. Photometry from publicly available survey images supports the conclusion that the other system is a highly sheared quadruply imaged quasar. In starting with objects thought to be galaxies, our lens finding technique complements the conventional approach of first identifying sources with quasar-like colours and subsequently finding evidence of lensing.

N2  - We report the discovery of a new gravitationally lensed quasar (double) from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) identified inside the ∼670deg<SUP>2</SUP> area encompassing the Magellanic Clouds. The source was selected as one of ∼60 `red W1 - W2' mid-infrared objects from WISE and having a significant amount of variability in OGLE for both two (or more) nearby sources. This is the first detection of a gravitational lens, where the discovery is made `the other way around', meaning we first measured the time delay between the two lensed quasar images of -132 < t<SUB>AB</SUB> < -76 d (90 per cent CL), with the median t<SUB>AB</SUB> ≈ -102 d (in the observer frame), and where the fainter image B lags image A. The system consists of the two quasar images separated by 1.5 arcsec on the sky, with I ≈ 20.0 mag and I ≈ 19.6 mag, respectively, and a lensing galaxy that becomes detectable as I ≈ 21.5 mag source, 1.0 arcsec from image A, after subtracting the two lensed images. Both quasar images show clear AGN broad emission lines at z = 2.16 in the New Technology Telescope spectra. The spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting with the fixed source redshift provided the estimate of the lensing galaxy redshift of z ≈ 0.9 ± 0.2 (90 per cent CL), while its type is more likely to be elliptical (the SED-inferred and lens-model stellar mass is more likely present in ellipticals) than spiral (preferred redshift by the lens model).

N2  - Fossil galaxy systems are classically thought to be the end result of galaxy group/cluster evolution, as galaxies experiencing dynamical friction sink to the center of the group potential and merge into a single, giant elliptical that dominates the rest of the members in both mass and luminosity. Most fossil systems discovered lie within z < 0.2, which leads to the question, what were these systems’ progenitors? Such progenitors are expected to have imminent or ongoing major merging near the brightest group galaxy that, when concluded, will meet the fossil criteria within the look forward time. Since strong gravitational lensing preferentially selects groups merging along the line of sight, or systems with a high mass concentration like fossil systems, we searched the CASSOWARY survey of strong-lensing events with the goal of determining whether lensing systems have any predisposition to being fossil systems or progenitors. We find that ∼13% of lensing groups are identified as traditional fossils while only ∼3% of nonlensing control groups are. We also find that ∼23% of lensing systems are traditional fossil progenitors compared to ∼17% for the control sample. Our findings show that strong-lensing systems are more likely to be fossil/pre-fossil systems than comparable nonlensing systems. Cumulative galaxy luminosity functions of the lensing and nonlensing groups also indicate a possible, fundamental difference between strong-lensing and nonlensing systems’ galaxy populations, with lensing systems housing a greater number of bright galaxies even in the outskirts of groups.

N2  - I present a timely spectroscopic follow-up of the newly discovered, quadruply lensed quasar PSOJ0147 from the Pan-STARRS 1 survey. The newly acquired optical spectra with GMOS onboard the Gemini North Telescope allow us to pin down the redshifts of both the foreground lensing galaxy and the background lensed quasar to be z = 0.572 and 2.341, providing a firm basis for cosmography with future high-cadence photometric monitoring. I also inspect difference spectra from two of the quasar images, revealing the microlensing effect. Long-term spectroscopic follow-ups will shed lights on the structure of the active galactic nucleus and its environment.

N2  - We report on discovery results from a quasar lens search in the ATLAS-DR3 public footprint. Spectroscopic follow-up campaigns, conducted at the 2.6 m Nordic Optical Telescope (La Palma) and 3.6 m New Technology Telescope (La Silla) in 2016, yielded seven pairs of quasars exhibiting the same lines at the same redshift and monotonic flux ratios with wavelength (hereafter NIQs, nearly identical quasar pairs). Magellan spectra of A0140-1152 (01<SUP>h</SUP>40<SUP>m</SUP>03{^s<SUB>.</SUB>}0-11<SUP>d</SUP>52<SUP>m</SUP>19{^s<SUB>.</SUB>}0, z<SUB>s</SUB> = 1.807) confirm it as a lens with deflector at z<SUB>l</SUB> = 0.277 and Einstein radius θ<SUB>E</SUB> = (0.73 ± 0.02) arcsec. Follow-up imaging of the NIQ A2213-2652 (22<SUP>h</SUP>13<SUP>m</SUP>38{^s<SUB>.</SUB>}4-26<SUP>d</SUP>52<SUP>m</SUP>27{^s<SUB>.</SUB>}1) reveals the deflector galaxy and confirms it as a lens. We show the use of spatial resolution from the Gaia mission to select lenses and list additional systems from a WISE-Gaia-ATLAS search, yielding three additional lenses (02<SUP>h</SUP>35<SUP>m</SUP>27{^s<SUB>.</SUB>}4-24<SUP>d</SUP>33<SUP>m</SUP>13{^s<SUB>.</SUB>}2, 02<SUP>h</SUP>59<SUP>m</SUP>33<SUP>s</SUP>-23<SUP>d</SUP>38<SUP>m</SUP>01{^s<SUB>.</SUB>}8, 01<SUP>h</SUP>46<SUP>m</SUP>32{^s<SUB>.</SUB>}9-11<SUP>d</SUP>33<SUP>m</SUP>39{^s<SUB>.</SUB>}0). The overall sample consists of 11 lenses/NIQs, plus three lenses known before 2016, over the ATLAS-DR3 footprint (≈3500 deg<SUP>2</SUP>). Finally, we discuss future prospects for objective classification of pair/NIQ/contaminant spectra.

N2  - Time delays between the multiple images of strongly gravitationally lensed Type Ia supernovae (glSNe Ia) have the potential to deliver precise cosmological constraints, but the effects of microlensing on time delay extraction have not been studied in detail. Here we quantify the effect of microlensing on the glSN Ia yield of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and the effect of microlensing on the precision and accuracy of time delays that can be extracted from LSST glSNe Ia. Microlensing has a negligible effect on the LSST glSN Ia yield, but it can be increased by a factor of ∼2 over previous predictions to 930 systems using a novel photometric identification technique based on spectral template fitting. Crucially, the microlensing of glSNe Ia is achromatic until three rest-frame weeks after the explosion, making the early-time color curves microlensing-insensitive time delay indicators. By fitting simulated flux and color observations of microlensed glSNe Ia with their underlying, unlensed spectral templates, we forecast the distribution of absolute time delay error due to microlensing for LSST, which is unbiased at the sub-percent level and peaked at 1% for color curve observations in the achromatic phase, while for light-curve observations it is comparable to state-of-the-art mass modeling uncertainties (4%). About 70% of LSST glSN Ia images should be discovered during the achromatic phase, indicating that microlensing time delay uncertainties can be minimized if prompt multicolor follow-up observations are obtained. Accounting for microlensing, the 1-2 day time delay on the recently discovered glSN Ia iPTF16geu can be measured to 40% precision, limiting its cosmological utility.

N2  - We report modelling follow-up of recently discovered gravitational-lens candidates in the Canada France Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey. Lens modelling was done by a small group of specially interested volunteers from the Space Warps citizen-science community who originally found the candidate lenses. Models are categorized according to seven diagnostics indicating (a) the image morphology and how clear or indistinct it is, (b) whether the mass map and synthetic lensed image appear to be plausible, and (c) how the lens-model mass compares with the stellar mass and the abundance-matched halo mass. The lensing masses range from ∼10<SUP>11</SUP> to >10<SUP>13</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. Preliminary estimates of the stellar masses show a smaller spread in stellar mass (except for two lenses): a factor of a few below or above ∼10<SUP>11</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. Therefore, we expect the stellar-to-total mass fraction to decline sharply as lensing mass increases. The most massive system with a convincing model is J1434+522 (SW 05). The two low-mass outliers are J0206-095 (SW 19) and J2217+015 (SW 42); if these two are indeed lenses, they probe an interesting regime of very low star formation efficiency. Some improvements to the modelling software (SpaghettiLens), and discussion of strategies regarding scaling to future surveys with more and frequent discoveries, are included.

N2  - In this work, we present our machine learning classification algorithm for identifying strong gravitational lenses from wide-area surveys using convolutional neural networks; LENSFLOW. We train and test the algorithm using a wide variety of strong gravitational lens configurations from simulations of lensing events. Images are processed through multiple convolutional layers that extract feature maps necessary to assign a lens probability to each image. LENSFLOW provides a ranking scheme for all sources that could be used to identify potential gravitational lens candidates by significantly reducing the number of images that have to be visually inspected. We apply our algorithm to the HST/ACS i-band observations of the COSMOS field and present our sample of identified lensing candidates. The developed machine learning algorithm is more computationally efficient and complimentary to classical lens identification algorithms and is ideal for discovering such events across wide areas from current and future surveys such as LSST and WFIRST.

N2  - We present a catalogue of 38 spectroscopically detected strong galaxy-galaxy gravitational lens candidates identified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV). We were able to simulate narrow-band images for eight of them demonstrating evidence of multiple images. Two of our systems are compound lens candidates, each with two background source-planes. One of these compound systems shows clear lensing features in the narrow-band image. Our sample is based on 2812 galaxies observed by the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA) integral field unit (IFU). This Spectroscopic Identification of Lensing Objects (SILO) survey extends the methodology of the Sloan Lens ACS Survey (SLACS) and BOSS Emission-Line Survey (BELLS) to lower redshift and multiple IFU spectra. We searched ∼1.5 million spectra, of which 3065 contained multiple high signal-to-noise ratio background emission-lines or a resolved [O ii] doublet, that are included in this catalogue. Upon manual inspection, we discovered regions with multiple spectra containing background emission-lines at the same redshift, providing evidence of a common source-plane geometry which was not possible in previous SLACS and BELLS discovery programs. We estimate more than half of our candidates have an Einstein radius ≳ 1.7 arcsec, which is significantly greater than seen in SLACS and BELLS. These larger Einstein radii produce more extended images of the background galaxy increasing the probability that a background emission-line will enter one of the IFU spectroscopic fibres, making detection more likely.

N2  - The submillimeter galaxy (SMG) HERMES J105751.1+573027 (hereafter HLock01) at z = 2.9574 ± 0.0001 is one of the brightest gravitationally lensed sources discovered in the Herschel Multi-tiered Extragalactic Survey. Apart from the high flux densities in the far-infrared, it is also extremely bright in the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV), with a total apparent magnitude m <SUB>UV</SUB> ≃ 19.7 mag. We report here deep spectroscopic observations with the Gran Telescopio Canarias of the optically bright lensed images of HLock01. Our results suggest that HLock01 is a merger system composed of the Herschel-selected SMG and an optically bright Lyman break-like galaxy (LBG), separated by only 3.3 kpc in projection. While the SMG appears very massive (M <SUB>*</SUB> ≃ 5 × 10<SUP>11</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB>), with a highly extinguished stellar component (A <SUB> V </SUB> ≃ 4.3 ), the LBG is a young, lower-mass (M <SUB>*</SUB> ≃ 1 × 10<SUP>10</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB>), but still luminous (10× {L}<SUB>UV</SUB>}<SUP>* </SUP>) satellite galaxy. Detailed analysis of the high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) rest-frame UV spectrum of the LBG shows complex kinematics of the gas, exhibiting both blueshifted and redshifted absorption components. While the blueshifted component is associated with strong galactic outflows from the massive stars in the LBG, as is common in most star-forming galaxies, the redshifted component may be associated with gas inflow seen along a favorable sightline to the LBG. We also find evidence of an extended gas reservoir around HLock01 at an impact parameter of 110 kpc, through the detection of C II λλ1334 absorption in the red wing of a bright Lyα emitter at z ≃ 3.327. The data presented here highlight the power of gravitational lensing in high S/N studies to probe deeply into the physics of high-z star-forming galaxies.

The lens was discovered by matching a photometric quasar catalogue compiled from Pan-STARRS1 and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer photometry to the Gaia data release 1 catalogue, exploiting the high spatial resolution of the latter (full width at half-maximum ∼0.1 arcsec) to identify the three brightest components of the lensed quasar system. Follow-up spectroscopic observations with the William Herschel Telescope confirm the multiple objects are quasars at redshift z<SUB>q</SUB> = 3.34. Further follow-up with Keck adaptive optics high-resolution imaging reveals that the system is composed of two lensing galaxies and the quasar is lensed into an ∼2.8 arcsec separation four-image cusp configuration with a fifth image clearly visible, and a 1.0 arcsec arc due to the lensed quasar host galaxy. The system is well modelled with two singular isothermal ellipsoids, reproducing the position of the fifth image. We discuss future prospects for measuring time delays between the images and constraining any offset between mass and light using the faintly detected Einstein arcs associated with the quasar host galaxy.

N2  - We report the discovery of eMACSJ1341-QG-1, a quiescent galaxy at z = 1.594 located behind the massive galaxy cluster eMACSJ1341.9-2442 (z = 0.835). The system was identified as a gravitationally lensed triple image in Hubble Space Telescope images obtained as part of a snapshot survey of the most X-ray luminous galaxy clusters at z > 0.5 and spectroscopically confirmed in ground-based follow-up observations with the ESO/X-Shooter spectrograph. From the constraints provided by the triple image, we derive a first, crude model of the mass distribution of the cluster lens, which predicts a gravitational amplification of a factor of ∼30 for the primary image and a factor of ∼6 for the remaining two images of the source, making eMACSJ1341-QG-1 by far the most strongly amplified quiescent galaxy discovered to date. Our discovery underlines the power of SNAPshot observations of massive, X-ray selected galaxy clusters for lensing-assisted studies of faint background populations.

N2  - We present the full sample of 118 galaxy-scale strong-lens candidates in the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) Survey for the Masses (S4TM) Survey, which are spectroscopically selected from the final data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Follow-up Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging observations confirm that 40 candidates are definite strong lenses with multiple lensed images. The foreground-lens galaxies are found to be early-type galaxies (ETGs) at redshifts 0.06-0.44, and background sources are emission-line galaxies at redshifts 0.22-1.29. As an extension of the SLACS Survey, the S4TM Survey is the first attempt to preferentially search for strong-lens systems with relatively lower lens masses than those in the pre-existing strong-lens samples. By fitting HST data with a singular isothermal ellipsoid model, we find that the total projected mass within the Einstein radius of the S4TM strong-lens sample ranges from 3 × 10<SUP>10</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> to 2 × 10<SUP>11</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. In Shu et al., we have derived the total stellar mass of the S4TM lenses to be 5 × 10<SUP>10</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> to 1 × 10<SUP>12</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. Both the total enclosed mass and stellar mass of the S4TM lenses are on average almost a factor of 2 smaller than those of the SLACS lenses, which also represent the typical mass scales of the current strong-lens samples. The extended mass coverage provided by the S4TM sample can enable a direct test, with the aid of strong lensing, for transitions in scaling relations, kinematic properties, mass structure, and dark-matter content trends of ETGs at intermediate-mass scales as noted in previous studies. <P />Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope (HST), obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by AURA, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555. These observations are associated with HST program #12210.

N2  - We present detailed modelling of the recently discovered, quadruply lensed quasar J0408-5354, with the aim of interpreting its remarkable configuration: besides three quasar images (A,B,D) around the main deflector (G1), a fourth image (C) is significantly reddened and dimmed by a perturber (G2) which is not detected in the Dark Energy Survey imaging data. From lens models incorporating (dust-corrected) flux ratios, we find a perturber Einstein radius 0.04 arcsec ≲ R<SUB>E, G2</SUB> ≲ 0.2 arcsec and enclosed mass M<SUB>p</SUB>(R<SUB>E, G2</SUB>) ≲ 1.0 × 10<SUP>10</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. The main deflector has stellar mass log _{10}(M_{\star }/M_{⊙})=11.49^{+0.46}_{-0.32}, a projected mass M<SUB>p</SUB>(R<SUB>E, G1</SUB>) ≈ 6 × 10<SUP>11</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> within its Einstein radius R<SUB>E, G1</SUB> = (1.85 ± 0.15) arcsec and predicted velocity dispersion 267-280 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Follow-up images from a companion monitoring campaign show additional components, including a candidate second source at a redshift between the quasar and G1. Models with free perturbers, and dust-corrected and delay-corrected flux ratios, are also explored. The predicted time-delays (Δt<SUB>AB</SUB> = (135.0 ± 12.6) d, Δt<SUB>BD</SUB> = (21.0 ± 3.5) d) roughly agree with those measured, but better imaging is required for proper modelling and comparison. We also discuss some lessons learnt from J0408-5354 on lensed quasar finding strategies, due to its chromaticity and morphology.

N2  - Gaia's exceptional resolution (FWHM ∼ 0.1 arcsec) allows identification and cataloguing of the multiple images of gravitationally lensed quasars. We investigate a sample of 49 known lensed quasars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) footprint, with image separations less than 2 arcsec, and find that eight are detected with multiple components in the first Gaia data release. In the case of the 41 single Gaia detections, we generally are able to distinguish these lensed quasars from single quasars when comparing Gaia flux and position measurements to those of Pan-STARRS and SDSS. This is because the multiple images of these lensed quasars are typically blended in ground-based imaging and therefore the total flux and a flux-weighted centroid are measured, which can differ significantly from the fluxes and centroids of the individual components detected by Gaia. We compare the fluxes through an empirical fit of Pan-STARRS griz photometry to the wide optical Gaia bandpass values using a sample of isolated quasars. The positional offsets are calculated from a recalibrated astrometric SDSS catalogue. Applying flux and centroid difference criteria to spectroscopically confirmed quasars, we discover four new sub-arcsecond-separation lensed quasar candidates which have two distinct components of similar colour in archival Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope or Hyper Suprime Cam data. Our method based on single Gaia detections can be used to identify the ∼1400 lensed quasars with image separation above 0.5 arcsec, expected to have only one image bright enough to be detected by Gaia.

N2  - Strong gravitational lensing provides an independent measurement of the Hubble parameter (H <SUB>0</SUB>). One remaining systematic is a bias from the additional mass due to a galaxy group at the lens redshift or along the sightline. We quantify this bias for more than 20 strong lenses that have well-sampled sightline mass distributions, focusing on the convergence κ and shear γ. In 23% of these fields, a lens group contributes ≥1% convergence bias; in 57%, there is a similarly significant line-of-sight group. For the nine time-delay lens systems, H <SUB>0</SUB> is overestimated by {11}<SUB>-2</SUB><SUP>+3</SUP>% on average when groups are ignored. In 67% of fields with total κ ≥slant 0.01, line-of-sight groups contribute ≳ 2× more convergence than do lens groups, indicating that the lens group is not the only important mass. Lens environment affects the ratio of four (quad) to two (double) image systems; all seven quads have lens groups while only 3 of 10 doubles do, and the highest convergences due to lens groups are in quads. We calibrate the γ-κ relation: {log}({κ }<SUB>{tot</SUB>})=(1.94+/- 0.34){log}({γ }<SUB>{tot</SUB>}) +(1.31+/- 0.49) with an rms scatter of 0.34 dex. Although shear can be measured directly from lensed images, unlike convergence, it can be a poor predictor of convergence; for 19% of our fields, κ is ≳ 2γ . Thus, accurate cosmology using strong gravitational lenses requires precise measurement and correction for all significant structures in each lens field.

N2  - I describe two novel techniques originally devised to select strongly lensed quasar candidates in wide-field surveys. The first relies on outlier selection in optical and mid-infrared magnitude space; the second combines mid-infrared colour selection with Gaia spatial resolution, to identify multiplets of objects with quasar-like colours. Both methods have already been applied successfully to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, ATLAS and Dark Energy Survey footprints: besides recovering known lenses from previous searches, they have led to new discoveries, including quadruply lensed quasars, which are rare within the rare-object class of quasar lenses. As a serendipitous by-product, at least four candidate Galactic streams in the South have been identified among foreground contaminants. There is considerable scope for tailoring the WISE-Gaia multiplet search to stellar-like objects, instead of quasar-like, and to automatically detect Galactic streams.

N2  - We report on the galaxy MACSJ0032-arc at z<SUB>CO</SUB> = 3.6314 discovered during the Herschel Lensing snapshot Survey of massive galaxy clusters, and strongly lensed by the cluster MACS J0032.1+1808. The successful detections of its rest-frame ultraviolet (UV), optical, far-infrared (FIR), millimeter, and radio continua, and of its CO emission enable us to characterize, for the first time at such a high redshift, the stellar, dust, and molecular gas properties of a compact star-forming galaxy with a size smaller than 2.5 kpc, a fairly low stellar mass of 4.8<SUP>+ 0.5</SUP><SUB>-1.0</SUB> × 10<SUP>9</SUP>M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, and a moderate IR luminosity of 4.8<SUP>+ 1.2</SUP><SUB>-0.6</SUB> × 10<SUP>11</SUP>L<SUB>⊙</SUB>. By combining the stretching effect of the lens with the high angular resolution imaging of the CO(1-0) line emission and the radio continuum at 5 GHz, we find that the bulk of the molecular gas mass and star formation seems to be spatially decoupled from the rest-frame UV emission. About 90% of the total star formation rate is undetected at rest-frame UV wavelengths because of severe obscuration by dust, but is seen through the thermal FIR dust emission and the radio synchrotron radiation. The observed CO(4-3) and CO(6-5) lines demonstrate that high-J transitions, at least up to J = 6, remain excited in this galaxy, whose CO spectral line energy distribution resembles that of high-redshift submm galaxies, even though the IR luminosity of MACSJ0032-arc is ten times lower. This high CO excitation is possibly due to the compactness of the galaxy. We find evidence that this high CO excitation has to be considered in the balance when estimating the CO-to-H<SUB>2</SUB> conversion factor. Indeed, the respective CO-to-H<SUB>2</SUB> conversion factors as derived from the correlation with metallicity and the FIR dust continuum can only be reconciled if excitation is accounted for. The inferred depletion time of the molecular gas in MACSJ0032-arc supports the decrease in the gas depletion timescale of galaxies with redshift, although to a lesser degree than predicted by galaxy evolution models. Instead, the measured molecular gas fraction as high as 60-79% in MACSJ0032-arc favors the continued increase in the gas fraction of galaxies with redshift as expected, despite the plateau observed between z 1.5 and z 2.5. <P />Based on observations carried out with the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer, the IRAM 30 m telescope, and the NRAO Karl G.

N2  - We report the serendipitous discovery of the first gravitationally lensed quasar candidate from Pan-STARRS. The grizy images reveal four point-like images with magnitudes between 14.9 and 18.1 mag. The colors of the point sources are similar, and they are more consistent with quasars than with stars or galaxies. The lensing galaxy is detected in the izy bands, with an inferred photometric redshift of ∼0.6, lower than that of the point sources. We successfully model the system with a singular isothermal ellipsoid with shear, using the relative positions of the five objects as constraints. While the brightness ranking of the point sources is consistent with that of the model, we find discrepancies between the model-predicted and observed fluxes, likely due to microlensing by stars and millilensing due to the dark matter substructure. In order to fully confirm the gravitational lens nature of this system and add it to the small but growing number of the powerful probes of cosmology and astrophysics represented by quadruply lensed quasars, we require further spectroscopy and high-resolution imaging.

N2  - We present new observations of the three nearest early-type galaxy (ETG) strong lenses discovered in the SINFONI Nearby Elliptical Lens Locator Survey (SNELLS). Based on their lensing masses, these ETGs were inferred to have a stellar initial mass function (IMF) consistent with that of the Milky Way, not the bottom-heavy IMF that has been reported as typical for high-σ ETGs based on lensing, dynamical, and stellar population synthesis techniques. We use these unique systems to test the consistency of IMF estimates derived from different methods. We first estimate the stellar M <SUB>*</SUB>/L using lensing and stellar dynamics. We then fit high-quality optical spectra of the lenses using an updated version of the stellar population synthesis models developed by Conroy & van Dokkum. When examined individually, we find good agreement among these methods for one galaxy. The other two galaxies show 2-3σ tension with lensing estimates, depending on the dark matter contribution, when considering IMFs that extend to 0.08 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. Allowing a variable low-mass cutoff or a nonparametric form of the IMF reduces the tension among the IMF estimates to <2σ. There is moderate evidence for a reduced number of low-mass stars in the SNELLS spectra, but no such evidence in a composite spectrum of matched-σ ETGs drawn from the SDSS. Such variation in the form of the IMF at low stellar masses (m ≲ 0.3 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>), if present, could reconcile lensing/dynamical and spectroscopic IMF estimates for the SNELLS lenses and account for their lighter M <SUB>*</SUB>/L relative to the mean matched-σ ETG. We provide the spectra used in this study to facilitate future comparisons.

N2  - We report an ultrabright lensed submillimeter galaxy (SMG) at z = 2.0439, WISE J132934.18+224327.3, identified as a result of a full-sky cross-correlation of the AllWISE and Planck compact source catalogs aimed to search for bright analogs of the SMG SMM J2135, the Cosmic Eyelash. Inspection of archival SCUBA-2 observations of the candidates revealed a source with fluxes ({S}<SUB>850μ {{m</SUB>}}=130 mJy) consistent with the Planck measurements. The centroid of the SCUBA-2 source coincides within 1 arcsec with the position of the AllWISE mid-IR source, and, remarkably, with an arc-shaped lensed galaxy in HST images at visible wavelengths. Low-resolution rest-frame UV-optical spectroscopy of this lensed galaxy obtained with 10.4 m GTC reveals the typical absorption lines of a starburst galaxy. Gemini-N near-IR spectroscopy provided a clear detection of {{{H}}}<SUB>α </SUB> emission. The lensed source appears to be gravitationally magnified by a massive foreground galaxy cluster lens at z = 0.44 modeling with Lenstool indicates a lensing amplification factor of 11 ± 2. We determine an intrinsic rest-frame 8-1000 μm luminosity, {L}<SUB>{IR</SUB>}, of (1.3+/- 0.1)× {10}<SUP>13</SUP> {L}<SUB>⊙ </SUB>, and a likely star formation rate (SFR) of ∼ 500{--}2000 {M}<SUB>⊙ </SUB> {{yr}}<SUP>-1</SUP>. The SED shows a remarkable similarity with the Cosmic Eyelash from optical-mid/IR to submillimeter/radio, albeit at higher fluxes.

N2  - Strong gravitational lens systems with time delays between the multiple images allow measurements of time-delay distances, which are primarily sensitive to the Hubble constant that is key to probing dark energy, neutrino physics and the spatial curvature of the Universe, as well as discovering new physics. We present H0LiCOW (H<SUB>0</SUB> Lenses in COSMOGRAIL's Wellspring), a program that aims to measure H<SUB>0</SUB> with <3.5 per cent uncertainty from five lens systems (B1608+656, RXJ1131-1231, HE 0435-1223, WFI2033-4723 and HE 1104-1805). We have been acquiring (1) time delays through COSMOGRAIL and Very Large Array monitoring, (2) high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope imaging for the lens mass modelling, (3) wide-field imaging and spectroscopy to characterize the lens environment and (4) moderate-resolution spectroscopy to obtain the stellar velocity dispersion of the lenses for mass modelling. In cosmological models with one-parameter extension to flat Λ cold dark matter, we expect to measure H<SUB>0</SUB> to <3.5 per cent in most models, spatial curvature Ω<SUB>k</SUB> to 0.004, w to 0.14 and the effective number of neutrino species to 0.2 (1σ uncertainties) when combined with current cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments. These are, respectively, a factor of ∼15, ∼2 and ∼1.5 tighter than CMB alone. Our data set will further enable us to study the stellar initial mass function of the lens galaxies, and the co-evolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies. This program will provide a foundation for extracting cosmological distances from the hundreds of time-delay lenses that are expected to be discovered in current and future surveys.

N2  - We report the discovery and spectroscopic confirmation of the quad-like lensed quasar system DES J0408-5354 found in the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 1 (Y1) data. This system was discovered during a search for DES Y1 strong lensing systems using a method that identified candidates as red galaxies with multiple blue neighbors. DES J0408-5354 consists of a central red galaxy surrounded by three bright (I< 20) blue objects and a fourth red object. Subsequent spectroscopic observations using the Gemini South telescope confirmed that the three blue objects are indeed the lensed images of a quasar with redshift z = 2.375, and that the central red object is an early-type lensing galaxy with redshift z = 0.597. DES J0408-5354 is the first quad lensed quasar system to be found in DES and begins to demonstrate the potential of DES to discover and dramatically increase the sample size of these very rare objects.

N2  - We present the discovery and preliminary characterization of a gravitationally lensed quasar with a source redshift z<SUB>s</SUB> = 2.74 and image separation of 2.9 arcsec lensed by a foreground z<SUB>l</SUB> = 0.40 elliptical galaxy. Since optical observations of gravitationally lensed quasars show the lens system as a superposition of multiple point sources and a foreground lensing galaxy, we have developed a morphology-independent multi-wavelength approach to the photometric selection of lensed quasar candidates based on Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) supervised machine learning. Using this technique and gi multicolour photometric observations from the Dark Energy Survey (DES), near-IR JK photometry from the VISTA Hemisphere Survey (VHS) and WISE mid-IR photometry, we have identified a candidate system with two catalogue components with I<SUB>AB</SUB> = 18.61 and I<SUB>AB</SUB> = 20.44 comprising an elliptical galaxy and two blue point sources. Spectroscopic follow-up with NTT and the use of an archival AAT spectrum show that the point sources can be identified as a lensed quasar with an emission line redshift of z = 2.739 ± 0.003 and a foreground early-type galaxy with z = 0.400 ± 0.002. We model the system as a single isothermal ellipsoid and find the Einstein radius θ<SUB>E</SUB> ∼ 1.47 arcsec, enclosed mass M<SUB>enc</SUB> ∼ 4 × 10<SUP>11</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and a time delay of ∼52 d. The relatively wide separation, month scale time delay duration and high redshift make this an ideal system for constraining the expansion rate beyond a redshift of 1.

N2  - How can we discover objects we did not know existed within the large data sets that now abound in astronomy? We present an outlier detection algorithm that we developed, based on an unsupervised Random Forest. We test the algorithm on more than two million galaxy spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and examine the 400 galaxies with the highest outlier score. We find objects which have extreme emission line ratios and abnormally strong absorption lines, objects with unusual continua, including extremely reddened galaxies. We find galaxy-galaxy gravitational lenses, double-peaked emission line galaxies and close galaxy pairs. We find galaxies with high ionization lines, galaxies that host supernovae and galaxies with unusual gas kinematics. Only a fraction of the outliers we find were reported by previous studies that used specific and tailored algorithms to find a single class of unusual objects. Our algorithm is general and detects all of these classes, and many more, regardless of what makes them peculiar. It can be executed on imaging, time series and other spectroscopic data, operates well with thousands of features, is not sensitive to missing values and is easily parallelizable.

N2  - We present predictions for time delays between multiple images of the gravitationally lensed supernova, iPTF16geu, which was recently discovered from the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF). As the supernova is of Type Ia where the intrinsic luminosity is usually well known, accurately measured time delays of the multiple images could provide tight constraints on the Hubble constant. According to our lens mass models constrained by the Hubble Space Telescope F814W image, we expect the maximum relative time delay to be less than a day, which is consistent with the maximum of 100 hr reported by Goobar et al. but places a stringent upper limit. Furthermore, the fluxes of most of the supernova images depart from expected values suggesting that they are affected by microlensing. The microlensing timescales are small enough that they may pose significant problems to measure the time delays reliably. Our lensing rate calculation indicates that the occurrence of a lensed SN in iPTF is likely. However, the observed total magnification of iPTF16geu is larger than expected, given its redshift. This may be a further indication of ongoing microlensing in this system.

N2  - We report the serendipitous discovery of a quadruply lensed source at z<SUB>s</SUB> = 3.76, HSC J115252+004733, from the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) Survey. The source is lensed by an early-type galaxy at z<SUB>l</SUB> = 0.466 and a satellite galaxy. Here, we investigate the properties of the source by studying its size and luminosity from the imaging and the luminosity and velocity width of the Ly-α line from the spectrum. Our analyses suggest that the source is most probably a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (LLAGN) but the possibility of it being a compact bright galaxy (e.g. a Lyman-α emitter or lyman break galaxy) cannot be excluded. The brighter pair of lensed images appears point-like except in the HSC I band (with a seeing ∼0.5 arcsec). The extended emission in the I-band image could be due to the host galaxy underneath the AGN, or alternatively, due to a highly compact lensed galaxy (without AGN) which appears point-like in all bands except in I band. We also find that the flux ratio of the brighter pair of images is different in the Ks band compared to optical wavelengths. Phenomena such as differential extinction and intrinsic variability cannot explain this chromatic variation. While microlensing from stars in the foreground galaxy is less likely to be the cause, it cannot be ruled out completely. If the galaxy hosts an AGN, then this represents the highest redshift quadruply imaged AGN known to date, enabling study of a distant LLAGN. Discovery of this unusually compact and faint source demonstrates the potential of the HSC survey.

N2  - I report discovery of a new galaxy-scale gravitational lens system, identified using public data from the Mapping Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey, as part of a systematic search for lensed background line emitters. The lens is SDSS J170124.01+372258.0, a giant elliptical galaxy with velocity dispersion σ = 256 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, at a redshift of z<SUB>l</SUB> = 0.122. After modelling and subtracting the target galaxy light, the integral-field data cube reveals [O II], [O III] and Hβ emission lines corresponding to a source at z<SUB>s</SUB> = 0.791, forming an identifiable ring around the galaxy centre. If the ring is formed by a single lensed source, then the Einstein radius is R<SUB>Ein</SUB> ≈ 2.3 arcsec, projecting to ∼5 kpc at the distance of the lens. The total projected lensing mass is M<SUB>Ein</SUB> = (3.6 ± 0.6) × 10<SUP>11</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, and the total J-band mass-to-light ratio is 3.0 ± 0.7 solar units. Plausible estimates of the likely dark matter content could reconcile this with a Milky Way-like initial mass function (IMF), for which M/L ≈ 1.5 is expected, but heavier IMFs are by no means excluded with the present data. An alternative interpretation of the system, with a more complex source plane, is also discussed. The discovery of this system bodes well for future lens searches based on MaNGA and other integral-field spectroscopic surveys.

N2  - A multiply lensed galaxy, MACS0647-JD, with a probable photometric redshift of z≃ {10.7}<SUB>-0.4</SUB><SUP>+0.6</SUP> is claimed to constitute one of the very earliest known galaxies, formed well before reionization was completed. However, spectral evidence that MACS0647-JD lies at high redshift has proven infeasible and so here we seek an independent-lensing-based “geometric redshift” derived from the angles between the three lensed images of MACS0647-JD, using our free-form mass model (WSLAP+) for the lensing cluster MACSJ0647.7+7015 (at z = 0.591). Our lens model uses the nine sets of multiple images, including those of MACS0647-JD, identified by the CLASH survey toward this cluster. We convincingly exclude the low-redshift regime of z < 3, for which convoluted critical curves are generated by our method, as the solution bends to accommodate the wide angles of MACS0647-JD for this low redshift. Instead, a best fit to all sets of lensed galaxy positions and redshifts provides a geometric redshift of z≃ {10.8}<SUB>-0.4</SUB><SUP>+0.3</SUP> for MACS0647-JD, strongly supporting the higher photometric redshift solution. Importantly, we find a tight linear relation between the relative brightnesses of all nine sets of multiply lensed images and their relative magnifications as predicted by our model. This agreement provides a benchmark for the quality of the lens model, and establishes the robustness of our free-form lensing method for measuring model-independent geometric source distances and for deriving objective central cluster mass distributions. After correcting for its magnification the luminosity of MACS0647-JD remains relatively high at M<SUB>UV</SUB> = -19.4, which is within a factor of a few in flux of some surprisingly luminous z ≃ 10-11 candidates discovered recently in Hubble blank field surveys.

N2  - We report the discovery of a very bright (r = 20.16), highly magnified, and yet intrinsically very luminous Lyα emitter (LAE) at z=2.82. This system comprises four images in the observer plane with a maximum separation of ∼ 6<SUP>\prime\prime</SUP> and it is lensed by a z=0.55 massive early-type galaxy. It was initially identified in the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey Emission-Line Lens Survey for GALaxy-Lyα EmitteR sYstems survey, and follow-up imaging and spectroscopic observations using the Gran Telescopio Canarias and William Herschel Telescope confirmed the lensing nature of this system. A lens model using a singular isothermal ellipsoid in an external shear field reproduces the main features of the system quite well, yielding an Einstein radius of 2.″95 ± 0.″10, and a total magnification factor for the LAE of 8.8 ± 0.4. This LAE is one of the brightest and most luminous galaxy-galaxy strong lenses known. We present initial imaging and spectroscopy showing the basic physical and morphological properties of this lensed system. <P />Based on observations made with the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) and William Herschel Telescope (WHT), in the Spanish Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos of the IAC, under Directors Discretionary Time (DDT programs IDs: GTC2016-054 and DDT2016-077).

N2  - We present an extensive spectroscopic follow-up campaign of 29 strong lensing (SL) selected galaxy clusters discovered primarily in the Second Red-Sequence Cluster Survey (RCS-2). Our spectroscopic analysis yields redshifts for 52 gravitational arcs present in the core of our galaxy clusters, which correspond to 35 distinct background sources that are clearly distorted by the gravitational potential of these clusters. These lensed galaxies span a wide redshift range of 0.8 ≤ z ≤ 2.9, with a median redshift of z<SUB>s</SUB> = 1.8 ± 0.1. We also measure reliable redshifts for 1004 cluster members, allowing us to obtain robust velocity dispersion measurements for 23 of these clusters, which we then use to determine their dynamical masses by using a simulation-based σ<SUB>DM</SUB> - M<SUB>200</SUB> scaling relation. The redshift and mass ranges covered by our SL sample are 0.22 ≤ z ≤ 1.01 and 5× {10}<SUP>13</SUP>≤slant {M}<SUB>200</SUB>/{h}<SUB>70</SUB><SUP>-1</SUP> {M}<SUB>⊙ </SUB>≤slant 1.9× {10}<SUP>15</SUP>, respectively. We analyze and quantify some possible effects that might bias our mass estimates, such as the presence of substructure, the region where cluster members are selected for spectroscopic follow-up, the final number of confirmed members, and line-of-sight effects. We find that 10 clusters of our sample with N<SUB>mem</SUB> ≳ 20 show signs of dynamical substructure. However, the velocity data of only one system is inconsistent with a uni-modal distribution. We therefore assume that the substructures are only marginal and not of comparable size to the clusters themselves. Consequently, our velocity dispersion and mass estimates can be used as priors for SL mass reconstruction studies and also represent an important step toward a better understanding of the properties of the SL galaxy cluster population.

N2  - We spectroscopically re-observed the gravitational lens system SDSS J1339+1310 using OSIRIS on the GTC. We also monitored the r-band variability of the two quasar images (A and B) with the LT over 143 epochs in the period 2009-2016. These new data in both the wavelength and time domains have confirmed that the system is an unusual microlensing factory. The C iv emission line is remarkably microlensed, since the microlensing magnification of B relative to that for A, μ<SUB>BA</SUB>, reaches a value of 1.4 ( 0.4 mag) for its core. Moreover, the B image shows a red wing enhancement of C iv flux (relative to A), and μ<SUB>BA</SUB> = 2 (0.75 mag) for the C iv broad-line emission. Regarding the nuclear continuum, we find a chromatic behaviour of μ<SUB>BA</SUB>, which roughly varies from 5 (1.75 mag) at 7000 Å to 6 (1.95 mag) at 4000 Å. We also detect significant microlensing variability in the r band, and this includes a number of microlensing events on timescales of 50-100 d. Fortunately, the presence of an intrinsic 0.7 mag dip in the light curves of A and B, permitted us to measure the time delay between both quasar images. This delay is Δt<SUB>AB</SUB> = 47 d (1σ confidence interval; A is leading), in good agreement with predictions of lens models. <P />Tables 1-3 are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A> (<A href="http://130.79.128.5">http://130.79.128.5</A>) or via <A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/596/A77">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/596/A77</A>

N2  - With a large, unique spectroscopic survey in the fields of 28 galaxy-scale strong gravitational lenses, we identify groups of galaxies in the 26 adequately sampled fields. Using a group-finding algorithm, we find 210 groups with at least 5 member galaxies; the median number of members is 8. Our sample spans redshifts of 0.04 ≤ z <SUB>grp</SUB> ≤ 0.76 with a median of 0.31, including 174 groups with 0.1 < z <SUB>grp</SUB> < 0.6. The groups have radial velocity dispersions of 60 ≤ σ <SUB>grp</SUB> ≤ 1200 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> with a median of 350 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. We also discover a supergroup in field B0712+472 at z = 0.29 that consists of three main groups. We recover groups similar to ∼85% of those previously reported in these fields within our redshift range of sensitivity and find 187 new groups with at least five members. The properties of our group catalog, specifically, (1) the distribution of σ <SUB>grp</SUB>, (2) the fraction of all sample galaxies that are group members, and (3) the fraction of groups with significant substructure, are consistent with those for other catalogs. The distribution of group virial masses agrees well with theoretical expectations. Of the lens galaxies, 12 of 26 (46%) (B1422+231, B1600+434, B2114+022, FBQS J0951+2635, HE0435-1223, HST J14113+5211, MG0751+2716, MGJ1654+1346, PG 1115+080, Q ER 0047-2808, RXJ1131-1231, and WFI J2033-4723) are members of groups with at least five galaxies, and one more (B0712+472) belongs to an additional, visually identified group candidate. There are groups not associated with the lens that still are likely to affect the lens model; in six of 25 (24%) fields (excluding the supergroup), there is at least one massive (σ <SUB>grp</SUB> ≥ 500 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) group or group candidate projected within 2‧ of the lens.

N2  - We report the discovery of an optical Einstein ring in the Sculptor constellation, IAC J010127-334319, in the vicinity of the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy. It is an almost complete ring (∼300°) with a diameter of ∼4.5 arcsec. The discovery was made serendipitously from inspecting Dark Energy Camera (DECam) archive imaging data. Confirmation of the object nature has been obtained by deriving spectroscopic redshifts for both components, lens and source, from observations at the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio CANARIAS (GTC) with the spectrograph OSIRIS. The lens, a massive early-type galaxy, has a redshift of z = 0.581, while the source is a starburst galaxy with redshift of z = 1.165. The total enclosed mass that produces the lensing effect has been estimated to be M<SUB>tot</SUB> = (1.86 ± 0.23) × 10<SUP>12</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>.

N2  - The South Pole Telescope has discovered 100 gravitationally lensed, high-redshift, dusty, star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). We present 0.″5 resolution 870 μ {{m}} Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array imaging of a sample of 47 DSFGs spanning z=1.9{--}5.7, and construct gravitational lens models of these sources. Our visibility-based lens modeling incorporates several sources of residual interferometric calibration uncertainty, allowing us to properly account for noise in the observations. At least 70% of the sources are strongly lensed by foreground galaxies ({μ }<SUB>870μ {{m</SUB>}} 2), with a median magnification of {μ }<SUB>870μ {{m</SUB>}}=6.3, extending to {μ }<SUB>870μ {{m</SUB>}} 30. We compare the intrinsic size distribution of the strongly lensed sources to a similar number of unlensed DSFGs and find no significant differences in spite of a bias between the magnification and intrinsic source size. This may indicate that the true size distribution of DSFGs is relatively narrow. We use the source sizes to constrain the wavelength at which the dust optical depth is unity and find this wavelength to be correlated with the dust temperature. This correlation leads to discrepancies in dust mass estimates of a factor of two compared to estimates using a single value for this wavelength. We investigate the relationship between the [C II] line and the far-infrared luminosity and find that the same correlation between the [C II]/{L}<SUB>{{FIR</SUB>}} ratio and {{{Σ }}}<SUB>{{FIR</SUB>}} found for low-redshift star-forming galaxies applies to high-redshift galaxies and extends at least two orders of magnitude higher in {{{Σ }}}<SUB>{{FIR</SUB>}}. This lends further credence to the claim that the compactness of the IR-emitting region is the controlling parameter in establishing the “[C II] deficit.”

N2  - We report the observation and confirmation of the first group- and cluster-scale strong gravitational lensing systems found in Dark Energy Survey data. Through visual inspection of data from the Science Verification season, we identified 53 candidate systems. We then obtained spectroscopic follow-up of 21 candidates using the Gemini Multi-object Spectrograph at the Gemini South telescope and the Inamori-Magellan Areal Camera and Spectrograph at the Magellan/Baade telescope. With this follow-up, we confirmed six candidates as gravitational lenses: three of the systems are newly discovered, and the remaining three were previously known. Of the 21 observed candidates, the remaining 15 either were not detected in spectroscopic observations, were observed and did not exhibit continuum emission (or spectral features), or were ruled out as lensing systems. The confirmed sample consists of one group-scale and five galaxy-cluster-scale lenses. The lensed sources range in redshift z ∼ 0.80-3.2 and in I-band surface brightness I <SUB>SB</SUB> ∼ 23-25 mag arcsec<SUP>-2</SUP> (2″ aperture). For each of the six systems, we estimate the Einstein radius θ <SUB>E</SUB> and the enclosed mass M <SUB>enc</SUB>, which have ranges θ <SUB>E</SUB> ∼ 5″-9″ and M <SUB>enc</SUB> ∼ 8 × 10<SUP>12</SUP> to 6 × 10<SUP>13</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, respectively. <P />This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.

N2  - We report the serendipitous discovery of HSC J142449-005322, a double source plane lens system in the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program. We dub the system Eye of Horus. The lens galaxy is a very massive early-type galaxy with stellar mass of ∼ 7× {10}<SUP>11</SUP> {M}<SUB>⊙ </SUB> located at {z}<SUB>{{L</SUB>}}=0.795. The system exhibits two arcs/rings with clearly different colors, including several knots. We have performed spectroscopic follow-up observations of the system with FIRE on Magellan. The outer ring is confirmed at {z}<SUB>{{S</SUB>}2}=1.988 with multiple emission lines, while the inner arc and counterimage is confirmed at {z}<SUB>{{S</SUB>}1}=1.302. This makes it the first double source plane system with spectroscopic redshifts of both sources. Interestingly, redshifts of two of the knots embedded in the outer ring are found to be offset by {{Δ }}z=0.002 from the other knots, suggesting that the outer ring consists of at least two distinct components in the source plane. We perform lens modeling with two independent codes and successfully reproduce the main features of the system. However, two of the lensed sources separated by ∼0.7 arcsec cannot be reproduced by a smooth potential, and the addition of substructure to the lens potential is required to reproduce them. Higher-resolution imaging of the system will help decipher the origin of this lensing feature and potentially detect the substructure.

N2  - As part of an all-sky follow-up of the Planck catalogue of Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) cluster candidates detected in the first 14 months of data, we are observing cluster candidates in the southern sky in the optical imaging and spectroscopy through an ESO Large Programme. Inspection of ESO New Technology Telescope (NTT) R-and z-band imaging data from our programme has revealed an unusually large and bright arc in the field of PSZ1 G311.65-18.48. We establish the basic photometric and morphological properties of the arc and provide conclusive evidence for the gravitational lensing nature of this object. Guided by the NTT images, we have obtained a long-slit spectrum with IMACS on the Magellan-I Baade Telescope, covering a part of the arc and the brightest cluster galaxy of PSZ1 G311.65-18.48. Our imaging data confirm the presence of a galaxy cluster coinciding (within 0.´6) with the position of the Planck SZ source. The arc is separated by ~30″ from the brightest cluster galaxy, which closely coincides with the center of curvature of the arc. A photometric analysis yields integrated (Vega) magnitudes of (R,z,J,K<SUB>s</SUB>) = (17.82,17.38,16.75,15.43) for the arc, more than one magnitude brighter than any previously known lensed arc at z ~ 2-3. The arc is a vigorously star-forming galaxy at z = 2.369, while the Planck SZ cluster lens is at z = 0.443.Even when allowing for lensing magnifications as high as μ = 100 still leads to the conclusion that the source galaxy is among the intrinsically most luminous normal (I.e., non-AGN) galaxies known at z ~ 2-3. <P />FITS files of all the reduced images are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A> (<A href="http://130.79.128.5">http://130.79.128.5</A>) or via <A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/590/L4">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/590/L4</A>

N2  - <BR /> Aims: We report a study on the statistical properties of the multiply imaged quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) to be detected within the Gaia survey. <BR /> Methods: We considered two types of potential deflectors, the singular isothermal sphere (SIS) and the singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE), to estimate the number of multiply imaged quasars as well as the normalized distributions of the redshifts of the lensed sources and of their associated deflectors. We also investigated the distribution of the lensing events as a function of their angular size and apparent magnitude. We compared the Gaia survey for multiply imaged quasars to typical ground-based surveys and to an ideal survey that would be carried out with a perfect instrument from space. <BR /> Results: Of the 6.64 × 10<SUP>5</SUP> QSOs brighter than G = 20 to be detected by Gaia, we expect the discovery of about 2886 multiply imaged sources, 450 of which are expected to be produced by a late-type galaxy. We expect only ~1600 of these multiply imaged quasars to have an angular separation between their images that is large enough to be resolved from seeing-limited observations, and ~80 of them to have more than two lensed images.

N2  - We present a list of candidate gravitationally lensed dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) from the HerMES Large Mode Survey and the Herschel Stripe 82 Survey. Together, these partially overlapping surveys cover 372 deg<SUP>2</SUP> on the sky. After removing local spiral galaxies and known radio-loud blazars, our candidate list of lensed DSFGs is composed of 77 sources with 500 μm flux densities (S <SUB>500</SUB>) greater than 100 mJy. Such sources are dusty starburst galaxies similar to the first bright sub-millimeter galaxies (SMGs) discovered with SCUBA. We expect a large fraction of this list to be strongly lensed, with a small fraction made up of bright SMG-SMG mergers that appear as hyper-luminous infrared galaxies ({L}<SUB>{IR</SUB>} {10}<SUP>13</SUP> {L}<SUB>⊙ </SUB>). Thirteen of the 77 candidates have spectroscopic redshifts from CO spectroscopy with ground-based interferometers, putting them at z 1 and well above the redshift of the foreground lensing galaxies. The surface density of our sample is 0.21 ± 0.03 deg<SUP>-2</SUP>. We present follow-up imaging of a few of the candidates to confirm their lensing nature. The sample presented here is an ideal tool for higher-resolution imaging and spectroscopic observations to understand the detailed properties of starburst phenomena in distant galaxies. <P />Herschel is an ESA space observatory with science instruments provided by European-led Principal Investigator consortia and with important participation from NASA.

N2  - Using the Australia Telescope Compact Array, we conducted a survey of CO J = 1 - 0 and J = 2 - 1 line emission towards strongly lensed high-redshift dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) previously discovered with the South Pole Telescope (SPT). Our sample comprises 17 sources that had CO-based spectroscopic redshifts obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment. We detect all sources with known redshifts in either CO J = 1 - 0 or J = 2 - 1. 12 sources are detected in the 7-mm continuum. The derived CO luminosities imply gas masses in the range (0.5-11) × 10<SUP>10</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and gas depletion time-scales t<SUB>dep</SUB> < 200 Myr, using a CO to gas mass conversion factor α<SUB>CO</SUB> = 0.8 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> (K km s<SUP>-1</SUP> pc<SUP>2</SUP>)<SUP>-1</SUP>. Combining the CO luminosities and dust masses, along with a fixed gas-to-dust ratio, we derive α<SUB>CO</SUB> factors in the range 0.4-1.8 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> (K km s<SUP>-1</SUP> pc<SUP>2</SUP>)<SUP>-1</SUP>, similar to what is found in other starbursting systems. We find small scatter in α<SUB>CO</SUB> values within the sample, even though inherent variations in the spatial distribution of dust and gas in individual cases could bias the dust-based α<SUB>CO</SUB> estimates. We find that lensing magnification factors based on the CO linewidth to luminosity relation (μ<SUB>CO</SUB>) are highly unreliable, but particularly when μ < 5. Finally, comparison of the gas and dynamical masses suggest that the average molecular gas fraction stays relatively constant at z = 2-5 in the SPT DSFG sample.

N2  - Measuring stellar velocity dispersions of quiescent galaxies beyond z∼ 2 is observationally challenging. Such measurements require near-infrared spectra with a continuum detection of at least moderate signal to noise, often necessitating long integrations. In this paper, we present deep X-Shooter spectroscopy of one of only two known gravitationally lensed massive quiescent galaxies at z 2. This galaxy is quadruply imaged, with the brightest images magnified by a factor of ∼5. The total exposure time of our data is 9.8 hr on-source; however, the magnification, and the slit placement encompassing two images, provides a total equivalent exposure time of 215 hr. From this deep spectrum we measure a redshift of ({z}<SUB>{spec</SUB>}=2.756+/- 0.001), making this one of the highest redshift quiescent galaxies that is spectroscopically confirmed. We simultaneously fit both the spectroscopic and photometric data to determine stellar population parameters and conclude that this galaxy is relatively young ({560}<SUB>-80</SUB><SUP>+100</SUP> {Myr}), of intermediate mass ({log} {M}<SUB>*</SUB>/{M}<SUB>⊙ </SUB>={10.59}<SUB>-0.05</SUB><SUP>+0.04</SUP>), consistent with low dust content ({A}<SUB>V</SUB>={0.20}<SUB>-0.20</SUB><SUP>+0.26</SUP>), and has quenched only relatively recently. This recent quenching is confirmed by strong Balmer absorption, particularly Hδ (H{δ }<SUB>A</SUB>={6.66}<SUB>-0.92</SUB><SUP>+0.96</SUP>). Remarkably, this proves that at least some intermediate-mass galaxies have already quenched as early as z∼ 2.8. Additionally, we have measured a velocity dispersion of (σ =187+/- 43 {km} {{{s}}}<SUP>-1</SUP>), making this the highest-redshift quiescent galaxy with a dispersion measurement. We confirm that this galaxy falls on the same mass fundamental plane (MFP) as galaxies at z = 2.2, consistent with little to no evolution in the MFP up to z = 2.8. Overall this galaxy is proof of the existence of intermediate-mass quenched galaxies in the distant universe, and that lensing is a powerful tool for determining their properties with improved accuracy.

N2  - We report the discovery of 13 confirmed two-image quasar lenses from a systematic search for gravitationally lensed quasars in the SDSS-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS). We adopted a methodology similar to that used in the SDSS Quasar Lens Search (SQLS). In addition to the confirmed lenses, we report 11 quasar pairs with small angular separations ( ≲ 2 arcsec) confirmed from our spectroscopy, which are either projected pairs, physical binaries, or possibly quasar lens systems whose lens galaxies have not yet been detected. The newly discovered quasar lens system, SDSS J1452+4224 at z<SUB>s</SUB> ≈ 4.8 is one of the highest redshift multiply imaged quasars found to date. Furthermore, we have over 50 good lens candidates yet to be followed up. Owing to the heterogeneous selection of BOSS quasars, the lens sample presented here does not have a well-defined selection function.

N2  - Optically bright, wide separation double (gravitationally lensed) quasars can be easily monitored, leading to light curves of great importance in determining the Hubble constant and other cosmological parameters, as well as the structure of active nuclei and haloes of galaxies. Searching for new double quasars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III) data base, we discovered SDSS J1442+4055. This consists of two bright images (r ∼ 18-19) of the same distant quasar at z = 2.575. The two quasar images are separated by ∼2{^''<SUB>.</SUB>}1, show significant parallel flux variations and can be monitored from late 2015. We also found other two double quasar candidates, SDSS J1617+3827 (z = 2.079) and SDSS J1642+3200 (z = 2.264), displaying evidence for the presence of a lensing object and parallel flux variations, but requiring further spectroscopic observations to be confirmed as lensed quasars.

N2  - Compound strong gravitational lensing is a rare phenomenon, but a handful of such lensed systems are likely to be discovered in forthcoming surveys. In this work, we use a double singular isothermal sphere lens model to analytically understand how the properties of the system impact image multiplicity for the final source. We find that up to six images of a background source can form, but only if the second lens is multiply imaged by the first and the Einstein radius of the second lens is comparable to, but does not exceed that of the first. We then build a model of compound lensing masses in the Universe, using singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) lenses, and assess how the optical depth for multiple imaging by a galaxy-galaxy compound lens varies with source redshift. For a source redshift of 4, we find optical depths of 6 × 10<SUP>-6</SUP> for multiple imaging and 5 × 10<SUP>-8</SUP> for multiplicity of 6 or greater. We find that extreme magnifications are possible, with magnifications of 100 or more for 6 × 10<SUP>-9</SUP> of z = 10 sources with 0.1 kpc radii. We show some of the image configurations that can be generated by compound lenses, and demonstrate that they are qualitatively different to those generated by single-plane lenses; dedicated compound lens finders will be necessary if these systems are to be discovered in forthcoming surveys.

N2  - We report on high-resolution JVLA and Chandra observations of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Frontier Cluster MACS J0717.5+3745. MACS J0717.5+3745 offers the largest contiguous magnified area of any known cluster, making it a promising target to search for lensed radio and X-ray sources. With the high-resolution 1.0-6.5 GHz JVLA imaging in A and B configuration, we detect a total of 51 compact radio sources within the area covered by the HST imaging. Within this sample, we find seven lensed sources with amplification factors larger than two. None of these sources are identified as multiply lensed. Based on the radio luminosities, the majority of these sources are likely star-forming galaxies with star-formation rates (SFRs) of 10-50 {M}<SUB>⊙ </SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> located at 1≲ z≲ 2. Two of the lensed radio sources are also detected in the Chandra image of the cluster. These two sources are likely active galactic nuclei, given their 2-10 keV X-ray luminosities of ∼10<SUP>43-44</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>. From the derived radio luminosity function, we find evidence for an increase in the number density of radio sources at 0.6 z 2.0, compared to a z 0.3 sample. Our observations indicate that deep radio imaging of lensing clusters can be used to study star-forming galaxies, with SFRs as low as ∼10 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, at the peak of cosmic star formation history.

N2  - We describe SPACE WARPS, a novel gravitational lens discovery service that yields samples of high purity and completeness through crowdsourced visual inspection. Carefully produced colour composite images are displayed to volunteers via a web-based classification interface, which records their estimates of the positions of candidate lensed features. Images of simulated lenses, as well as real images which lack lenses, are inserted into the image stream at random intervals; this training set is used to give the volunteers instantaneous feedback on their performance, as well as to calibrate a model of the system that provides dynamical updates to the probability that a classified image contains a lens. Low-probability systems are retired from the site periodically, concentrating the sample towards a set of lens candidates. Having divided 160 deg<SUP>2</SUP> of Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey imaging into some 430 000 overlapping 82 by 82 arcsec tiles and displaying them on the site, we were joined by around 37 000 volunteers who contributed 11 million image classifications over the course of eight months. This stage 1 search reduced the sample to 3381 images containing candidates; these were then refined in stage 2 to yield a sample that we expect to be over 90 per cent complete and 30 per cent pure, based on our analysis of the volunteers performance on training images. We comment on the scalability of the SPACE WARPS system to the wide field survey era, based on our projection that searches of 10<SUP>5</SUP> images could be performed by a crowd of 10<SUP>5</SUP> volunteers in 6 d.

N2  - We report the discovery of 29 promising (and 59 total) new lens candidates from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS) based on about 11 million classifications performed by citizen scientists as part of the first SPACE WARPS lens search. The goal of the blind lens search was to identify lens candidates missed by robots (the RINGFINDER on galaxy scales and ARCFINDER on group/cluster scales) which had been previously used to mine the CFHTLS for lenses. We compare some properties of the samples detected by these algorithms to the SPACE WARPS sample and find them to be broadly similar. The image separation distribution calculated from the SPACE WARPS sample shows that previous constraints on the average density profile of lens galaxies are robust. SPACE WARPS recovers about 65 per cent of known lenses, while the new candidates show a richer variety compared to those found by the two robots. This detection rate could be increased to 80 per cent by only using classifications performed by expert volunteers (albeit at the cost of a lower purity), indicating that the training and performance calibration of the citizen scientists is very important for the success of SPACE WARPS. In this work we present the SIMCT pipeline, used for generating in situ a sample of realistic simulated lensed images. This training sample, along with the false positives identified during the search, has a legacy value for testing future lens-finding algorithms. We make the pipeline and the training set publicly available.

N2  - COSMOGRAIL is a long-term photometric monitoring of gravitationally lensed quasars aimed at implementing Refsdal's time-delay method to measure cosmological parameters, in particular H<SUB>0</SUB>. Given the long and well sampled light curves of strongly lensed quasars, time-delay measurements require numerical techniques whose quality must be assessed. To this end, and also in view of future monitoring programs or surveys such as the LSST, a blind signal processing competition named Time Delay Challenge 1 (TDC1) was held in 2014. The aim of the present paper, which is based on the simulated light curves from the TDC1, is double. First, we test the performance of the time-delay measurement techniques currently used in COSMOGRAIL. Second, we analyse the quantity and quality of the harvest of time delays obtained from the TDC1 simulations. To achieve these goals, we first discover time delays through a careful inspection of the light curves via a dedicated visual interface. Our measurement algorithms can then be applied to the data in an automated way. We show that our techniques have no significant biases, and yield adequate uncertainty estimates resulting in reduced χ<SUP>2</SUP> values between 0.5 and 1.0. We provide estimates for the number and precision of time-delay measurements that can be expected from future time-delay monitoring campaigns as a function of the photometric signal-to-noise ratio and of the true time delay. We make our blind measurements on the TDC1 data publicly available.

N2  - We present spectroscopic confirmation of two new gravitationally lensed quasars, discovered in the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) based on their multiband photometry and extended morphology in DES images. Images of DES J0115-5244 show a red galaxy with two blue point sources at either side, which are images of the same quasar at z<SUB>s</SUB> = 1.64 as obtained by our long-slit spectroscopic data. The Einstein radius estimated from the DES images is 0.51 arcsec. DES J2146-0047 is in the area of overlap between DES and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Two blue components are visible in the DES and SDSS images. The SDSS fibre spectrum shows a quasar component at z<SUB>s</SUB> = 2.38 and absorption by Mg II and Fe II at z<SUB>l</SUB> = 0.799, which we tentatively associate with the foreground lens galaxy. Our long-slit spectra show that the blue components are resolved images of the same quasar. The Einstein radius is 0.68 arcsec, corresponding to an enclosed mass of 1.6 × 10<SUP>11</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. Three other candidates were observed and rejected, two being low-redshift pairs of starburst galaxies, and one being a quasar behind a blue star. These first confirmation results provide an important empirical validation of the data mining and model-based selection that is being applied to the entire DES data set.

N2  - We present a detailed analysis of an individual case of gravitational lensing of a z ∼ 8 Lyman-break galaxy (LBG) in a blank field, identified in Hubble Space Telescope imaging obtained as part of the Brightest of Reionizing Galaxies survey. To investigate the close proximity of the bright (m<SUB>AB</SUB> = 25.8) Y<SUB>098</SUB>-dropout to a small group of foreground galaxies, we obtained deep spectroscopy of the dropout and two foreground galaxies using VLT/X-Shooter. We detect H α, H β, [O III] and [O II] emission in the brightest two foreground galaxies (unresolved at the natural seeing of 0.8 arcsec), placing the pair at z = 1.327. We can rule out emission lines contributing all of the observed broad-band flux in H<SUB>160</SUB> band at 70σ, allowing us to exclude the z ∼ 8 candidate as a low-redshift interloper with broad-band photometry dominated by strong emission lines. The foreground galaxy pair lies at the peak of the luminosity, redshift and separation distributions for deflectors of strongly lensed z ∼ 8 objects, and we make a marginal detection of a demagnified secondary image in the deepest (J<SUB>125</SUB>) filter. We show that the configuration can be accurately modelled by a singular isothermal ellipsoidal deflector and a Sérsic source magnified by a factor of μ = 4.3 ± 0.2. The reconstructed source in the best-fitting model is consistent with luminosities and morphologies of z ∼ 8 LBGs in the literature. The lens model yields a group mass of 9.62 ± 0.31 × 10<SUP>11</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and a stellar mass-to-light ratio for the brightest deflector galaxy of M_{⋆}/L<SUB>B</SUB>=2.3^{+0.8}_{-0.6} M_{⊙}/L_{⊙} within its effective radius. The foreground galaxies' redshifts would make this one of the few strong lensing deflectors discovered at z > 1. Deeper imaging would allow for confirmation of the existence of the secondary image and elongation in the primary image, verifying multiple imaging and producing more robust estimations of the image magnifications.

N2  - We report the discovery of RG1M0150, a massive, recently quenched galaxy at z = 2.636 that is multiply imaged by the cluster MACSJ0150.3-1005. We derive a stellar mass of {log}{M}<SUB>*</SUB>={11.49}<SUB>-0.16</SUB><SUP>+0.10</SUP> and a half-light radius of {R}<SUB>e,{maj</SUB>}=1.8+/- 0.4 {{kpc}}. Taking advantage of the lensing magnification, we are able to spatially resolve a remarkably massive yet compact quiescent galaxy at z 2 in ground-based near-infrared spectroscopic observations using Magellan/FIRE and Keck/MOSFIRE. We find no gradient in the strength of the Balmer absorption lines over 0.6{R}<SUB>e</SUB>-1.6{R}<SUB>e</SUB>, which are consistent with an age of 760 Myr. Gas emission in [N ii] broadly traces the spatial distribution of the stars and is coupled with weak Hα emission (log [N ii]/{{H}}α =0.6+/- 0.2), indicating that OB stars are not the primary ionizing source. The velocity dispersion within the effective radius is {σ }<SUB>e,{stars</SUB>}=271+/- 41 km s{}<SUP>-1</SUP>. We detect rotation in the stellar absorption lines for the first time beyond z∼ 1. Using a two-integral Jeans model that accounts for observational effects, we measure a dynamical mass of {log}{M}<SUB>{{dyn</SUB>}}=11.24+/- 0.14 and V/σ =0.70+/- 0.21. This is a high degree of rotation considering the modest observed ellipticity of 0.12 ± 0.08, but it is consistent with predictions from dissipational merger simulations that produce compact remnants. The mass of RG1M0150 implies that it is likely to become a slowly rotating elliptical. If it is typical, this suggests that the progenitors of massive ellipticals retain significant net angular momentum after quenching which later declines, perhaps through accretion of satellites.

N2  - We present an analysis of CO spectroscopy and infrared-to-millimetre dust photometry of 11 exceptionally bright far-infrared (FIR) and sub-mm sources discovered through a combination of the Planck all-sky survey and follow-up Herschel-SPIRE imaging - "Planck's Dusty Gravitationally Enhanced subMillimetre Sources". Each source has a secure spectroscopic redshift z = 2.2-3.6 from multiple lines obtained through a blind redshift search with EMIR at the IRAM 30-m telescope. Interferometry was obtained at IRAM and the SMA, and along with optical/near-infrared imaging obtained at the CFHT and the VLT reveal morphologies consistent with strongly gravitationally lensed sources, including several giant arcs. Additional photometry was obtained with JCMT/SCUBA-2 and IRAM/GISMO at 850 μm and 2 mm, respectively. The SEDs of our sources peak near either the 350 μm or 500 μm bands of SPIRE with peak flux densities between 0.35 and 1.14 Jy. All objects are extremely bright isolated point sources in the 18'' beam of SPIREat 250 μm, with apparent FIR luminosities of up to 3 × 10<SUP>14</SUP> L<SUB>⊙</SUB> (not correcting for the lensing effect). Their morphologies, sizes, CO line widths, CO luminosities, dust temperatures, and FIR luminosities provide additional empirical evidence that these are amongst the brightest strongly gravitationally lensed high-redshift galaxies on the sub-mm sky. Our programme extends the successful wide-area searches for strongly gravitationally lensed high-redshift galaxies (carried out with the South Pole Telescope and Herschel) towards even brighter sources, which are so rare that their systematic identification requires a genuine all-sky survey like Planck. Six sources are above the ≃600 mJy 90% completeness limit of the Planck catalogue of compact sources (PCCS) at 545 and 857 GHz, which implies that these must literally be amongst the brightest high-redshift FIR and sub-mm sources on the extragalactic sky. We discuss their dust masses and temperatures, and use additional WISE 22-μm photometry and template fitting to rule out a significant contribution of AGN heating to the total infrared luminosity. Six sources are detected in FIRST at 1.4 GHz, and the others have sensitive upper limits. Four have flux densities brighter than expected from the local FIR-radio correlation, but in the range previously found for high-z sub-mm galaxies, one has a deficit of FIR emission, and 6 are consistent with the local correlation, although this includes 3 galaxies with upper limits. We attribute this to the turbulent interstellar medium of these galaxies, rather than the presence of radio AGN. The global dust-to-gas ratios and star-formation efficiencies of our sources are predominantly in the range expected from massive, metal-rich, intense, high-redshift starbursts. An extensive multi-wavelength follow-up programme is being carried out to further characterize these sources and the intense star formation within them. <P />Based on observations collected with the Herschel and Planck satellites, IRAM, SMA, JCMT, CFHT, and the VLT.

N2  - We report the discovery of a gravitationally lensed hyperluminous infrared galaxy (intrinsic L<SUB>IR</SUB> ≈ 10<SUP>13</SUP> L<SUB>⊙</SUB>) with strong radio emission (intrinsic L<SUB>1.4 GHz</SUB> ≈ 10<SUP>25</SUP> W Hz<SUP>-1</SUP>) at z = 2.553. The source was identified in the citizen science project SPACE WARPS through the visual inspection of tens of thousands of iJK<SUB>s</SUB> colour composite images of luminous red galaxies (LRGs), groups and clusters of galaxies and quasars. Appearing as a partial Einstein ring (r<SUB>e</SUB> ≈ 3 arcsec) around an LRG at z = 0.2, the galaxy is extremely bright in the sub-millimetre for a cosmological source, with the thermal dust emission approaching 1 Jy at peak. The redshift of the lensed galaxy is determined through the detection of the CO(3→2) molecular emission line with the Large Millimetre Telescope's Redshift Search Receiver and through [O III] and Hα line detections in the near-infrared from Subaru/Infrared Camera and Spectrograph. We have resolved the radio emission with high-resolution (300-400 mas) eMERLIN L-band and Very Large Array C-band imaging. These observations are used in combination with the near-infrared imaging to construct a lens model, which indicates a lensing magnification of μ ≈ 10. The source reconstruction appears to support a radio morphology comprised of a compact (<250 pc) core and more extended component, perhaps indicative of an active nucleus and jet or lobe.

N2  - Context. Galaxy-scale gravitational lenses are powerful tools, which can be used to address major astrophysical questions that are still open. They can be identified either through imaging or through spectroscopy, which is less efficient than imaging but offers the major advantage of having both source and deflector red shift previously measured at discovery. Spectroscopic identification requires huge data sets of high spectral quality, such as the SDSS, and has so far focused on early-type galaxies, as the most massive galaxies are found among them. <BR /> Aims: We aimed to perform spectroscopic identification of disk galaxies acting as gravitational lenses. <BR /> Methods: We have selected about 300 000 galaxy spectra with EW(H<SUB>α</SUB>) ≤-10 Å from the SDSS DR 8. On these spectra, we ran our original code RES, which is a fast, reliable tool able to provide a red-shift measure and to identify discordant red-shift systems if present. We have required RES to identify only systems based on a minimum number of four emission lines. We have inspected all the (54) SDSS images of the double z systems identified by RES and discarded systems for which z duplicity could be easily ascribed to the presence of two distinct objects. The remaining 25 systems, for which double z is very likely to be due to the gravitational lensing phenomenon, constitute our sample. <BR /> Results: For each gravitational lens candidate system, we provide SDSS identification and image emission lines detected by RES and activity classification, when derivable. The disky nature of our candidate lenses is confirmed by their images, stellar mass estimates, g - r rest-frame colours and occurrence of star burst phenomena.

N2  - Ongoing and future imaging surveys represent significant improvements in depth, area, and seeing compared to current data sets. These improvements offer the opportunity to discover up to three orders of magnitude more galaxy-galaxy strong lenses than are currently known. In this work we forecast the number of lenses that will be discoverable in forthcoming surveys and simulate their properties. We generate a population of statistically realistic strong lenses and simulate observations of this population for the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), and Euclid surveys. We verify our model against the galaxy-scale lens search of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey, predicting 250 discoverable lenses compared to 220 found by Gavazzi et al. The predicted Einstein radius distribution is also remarkably similar to that found by Sonnenfeld et al. For future surveys we find that, assuming Poisson limited lens galaxy subtraction, searches of the DES, LSST, and Euclid data sets should discover 2400, 120000, and 170000 galaxy-galaxy strong lenses, respectively. Finders using blue-minus-red (g-i) difference imaging for lens subtraction can discover 1300 and 62000 lenses in DES and LSST. The uncertainties on the model are dominated by the high-redshift source population, which typically gives fractional errors on the discoverable lens number at the level of tens of percent. We find that doubling the signal-to-noise ratio required for a lens to be detectable approximately halves the number of detectable lenses in each survey, indicating the importance of understanding the selection function and the sensitivity of future lens finders in interpreting strong lens statistics. We make our population forecasting and simulated observation codes publicly available so that the selection function of strong lens finders can easily be calibrated.

N2  - GRAMORs are GRAvitationally highly magnified yet MORphologically regular images. An example of this phenomenon was discovered in the cluster MACS J1149.5+2223 in 2009. We investigate the lens statistics of GRAMORs in detail. Assuming a NFW profile for a sample of clusters, we calculate the expected number and redshift distribution of GRAMORs using parameters from COSMOS data for the number density of the background galaxy. A model with a cluster placed at z = 0.544 based on WMAP5 cosmology predicts the redshift of a GRAMOR at z≃ 1.49 which is close to the observed z = 1.4906. These results show that the expected number of GRAMORs is about two per cluster in the most likely case, and thus a large number of GRAMORs would be observed in a systematic survey. The probability distribution function of source redshift for GRAMORs depends strongly on dark energy and may be useful for constraining the nature of dark energy.

N2  - We present observational results from a new Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Snapshot program to extend the methods of the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) Survey to lower lens-galaxy masses. We discover 40 new galaxy-scale strong lenses, which we supplement with 58 previously discovered SLACS lenses. In addition, we determine the posterior PDFs of the Einstein radius for 33 galaxies (18 new and 15 from legacy SLACS data) based on single lensed images. We find a less-than-unity slope of 0.64 ± 0.06 for the {{log }<SUB>10</SUB>}{{σ }<SUB>*</SUB>}-{{log }<SUB>10</SUB>}{{σ }<SUB>SIE</SUB>} relation, which corresponds to a 6σ evidence that the total mass-density profile of early-type galaxies varies systematically in the sense of being shallower at higher lens-galaxy velocity dispersions. The trend is only significant when single-image systems are considered, highlighting the importance of including both “lenses” and “nonlenses” for an unbiased treatment of the lens population when extending to lower mass ranges. By scaling simple stellar-population models to the HST I-band data, we identify a strong trend of increasing dark-matter fraction at higher velocity dispersions, which can be alternatively interpreted as a trend in the stellar initial mass function (IMF) normalization. Consistent with previous findings and the suggestion of a nonuniversal IMF, we find that a Salpeter IMF is ruled out for galaxies with velocity dispersion less than 180 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Considered together, our mass-profile and dark-matter fraction trends with increasing galaxy mass could both be explained by an increasing relative contribution on kiloparsec scales from a dark-matter halo with a spatial profile more extended than that of the stellar component. <P />Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by AURA, Inc., under NASA Contract NAS 5-26555.

N2  - In 1964, Refsdal hypothesized that a supernova whose light traversed multiple paths around a strong gravitational lens could be used to measure the rate of cosmic expansion. We report the discovery of such a system. In Hubble Space Telescope imaging, we have found four images of a single supernova forming an Einstein cross configuration around a redshift z = 0.54 elliptical galaxy in the MACS J1149.6+2223 cluster. The cluster’s gravitational potential also creates multiple images of the z = 1.49 spiral supernova host galaxy, and a future appearance of the supernova elsewhere in the cluster field is expected. The magnifications and staggered arrivals of the supernova images probe the cosmic expansion rate, as well as the distribution of matter in the galaxy and cluster lenses.

N2  - We present a revised lens model of MACS J1149+2223, in which the first resolved multiply imaged lensed supernova (SN) was discovered. The lens model is based on the model of Johnson et al. with some modifications. We include more lensing constraints from the host galaxy of the newly discovered SN, and increase the flexibility of the model in order to better reproduce the lensing signal in the vicinity of this galaxy. The revised model accurately reconstructs the positions of the lensed SN, provides magnifications, and predicts the time delay between the instances of the SN. Finally, we reconstruct the source image of the host galaxy, and position the SN on one of its spiral arms. Products of this lens model are available to the community through MAST. <P />Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained from the Data Archive at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.

N2  - MS 0451.6-0305 is a rich galaxy cluster whose strong lensing is particularly prominent at submm wavelengths. We combine new Submillimetre Common-User Bolometer Array (SCUBA)-2 data with imaging from Herschel Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE) and PACS and Hubble Space Telescope in order to try to understand the nature of the sources being lensed. In the region of the `giant submm arc', we uncover seven multiply imaged galaxies (up from the previously known four), of which six are found to be at a redshift of z ∼ 2.9, and possibly constitute an interacting system. Using a novel forward-modelling approach, we are able to simultaneously deblend and fit spectral energy distributions to the individual galaxies that contribute to the giant submm arc, constraining their dust temperatures, far-infrared luminosities, and star formation rates (SFRs). The submm arc first identified by SCUBA can now be seen to be composed of at least five distinct sources, four of these within a galaxy group at z ∼ 2.9. Only a handful of lensed galaxy groups at this redshift are expected on the sky, and thus this is a unique opportunity for studying such systems in detail. The total unlensed luminosity for this galaxy group is (3.1 ± 0.3) × 10<SUP>12</SUP> L<SUB>⊙</SUB>, which gives an unlensed SFR of (450 ± 50) M<SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. This finding suggests that submm source multiplicity, due to physically associated groupings as opposed to chance alignment, extends to fainter flux densities than previously discovered. Many of these systems may also host optical companions undetected in the submm, as is the case here.

N2  - We present the result of Subaru Telescope multiband adaptive optics observations of the complex gravitationally lensed quasar SDSS J1405+0959, which is produced by two lensing galaxies. These observations reveal dramatically enhanced morphological detail, leading to the discovery of an additional object 0.26 arcsec from the secondary lensing galaxy, as well as three collinear clumps located in between the two lensing galaxies. The new object is likely to be the third quasar image, although the possibility that it is a galaxy cannot be entirely excluded. If confirmed via future observations, it would be the first three-image lensed quasar produced by two galaxy lenses. In either case, we show based on gravitational lensing models and photometric redshift that the collinear clumps represent merging images of a portion of the quasar host galaxy, with a magnification factor of ∼ 15-20, depending on the model.

N2  - Clusters of galaxies have a huge mass which can act as gravitational lenses. Galaxies behind clusters can be distorted by the lenses to form arcs in images. Herein a search was done for giant lensed arcs using the SDSS data. By visually inspecting SDSS images of newly identified clusters in the SDSS DR8 and Stripe 82 data, we discover 8 strong lensing clusters together with additional 3 probable and 6 possible cases. The lensed arcs show bluer colors than the member galaxies of clusters. The masses and optical luminosities of galaxy clusters interior to the arcs are calculated. The mass-to-light ratios are found to be in the range of a few tens of M <SUB>⊙</SUB>/ L <SUB>⊙</SUB>, consistent with the distribution of previously known lensing clusters.

N2  - The deflection angles of lensed sources increase with their distance behind a given lens. We utilize this geometric effect to corroborate the z <SUB>phot</SUB> ~= 9.8 photometric redshift estimate of a faint near-IR dropout, triply imaged by the massive galaxy cluster A2744 in deep Hubble Frontier Fields images. The multiple images of this source follow the same symmetry as other nearby sets of multiple images that bracket the critical curves and have well-defined redshifts (up to z <SUB>spec</SUB> ~= 3.6), but with larger deflection angles, indicating that this source must lie at a higher redshift. Similarly, our different parametric and non-parametric lens models all require this object be at z >~ 4, with at least 95% confidence, thoroughly excluding the possibility of lower-redshift interlopers. To study the properties of this source, we correct the two brighter images for their magnifications, leading to a star formation rate of ~0.3 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, a stellar mass of ~4 × 10<SUP>7</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, and an age of <~ 220 Myr (95% confidence). The intrinsic apparent magnitude is 29.9 AB (F160W), and the rest-frame UV (~1500 Å) absolute magnitude is M <SUB>UV, AB</SUB> = -17.6. This corresponds to {∼ }0.1 L<SUP>*</SUP><SUB>z=8</SUB> ({∼ }0.2 L<SUP>*</SUP><SUB>z=10</SUB>, adopting dM*/dz ~ 0.45), making this candidate one of the least luminous galaxies discovered at z ~ 10.

N2  - We identify a strong lensing galaxy in the cluster IRC 0218 (also known as XMM-LSS J02182-05102) that is spectroscopically confirmed to be at z = 1.62, making it the highest-redshift strong lens galaxy known. The lens is one of the two brightest cluster galaxies and lenses a background source galaxy into an arc and a counterimage. With Hubble Space Telescope (HST) grism and Keck/LRIS spectroscopy, we measure the source redshift to be z <SUB>S</SUB> = 2.26. Using HST imaging in ACS/F475W, ACS/F814W, WFC3/F125W, and WFC3/F160W, we model the lens mass distribution with an elliptical power-law profile and account for the effects of the cluster halo and nearby galaxies. The Einstein radius is θ _E=0.38<SUP>+0.02</SUP><SUB>-0.01</SUB> arcsec (3.2<SUB>-0.1</SUB><SUP>+0.2</SUP> kpc) and the total enclosed mass is M _tot (< θ _E)=1.8<SUP>+0.2</SUP><SUB>-0.1</SUB>× 10<SUP>11</SUP> M<SUB>⊙ </SUB>. We estimate that the cluster environment contributes ~10% of this total mass. Assuming a Chabrier initial mass function (IMF), the dark matter fraction within θ<SUB>E</SUB> is f_DM<SUP>Chab</SUP> = 0.3<SUB>-0.3</SUB><SUP>+0.1</SUP>, while a Salpeter IMF is marginally inconsistent with the enclosed mass (f_DM<SUP>Salp</SUP> = -0.3<SUB>-0.5</SUB><SUP>+0.2</SUP>). The total magnification of the source is μ _tot=2.1<SUB>-0.3</SUB><SUP>+0.4</SUP>. The source has at least one bright compact region offset from the source center. Emission from Lyα and [O III] are likely to probe different regions in the source. <P />Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555. These observations are associated with program No. 12590.

N2  - We report the discovery of four doubly imaged quasar lenses. All the four systems are selected as lensed quasar candidates from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data. We confirm their lensing hypothesis with additional imaging and spectroscopic follow-up observations. The discovered lenses are SDSS J0743+2457 with the source redshift z<SUB>s</SUB> = 2.165, the lens redshift z<SUB>l</SUB> = 0.381, and the image separation θ = 1.''034, SDSS J1128+2402 with z<SUB>s</SUB> = 1.608 and θ = 0.''844, SDSS J1405+0959 with z<SUB>s</SUB> = 1.810, z<SUB>l</SUB> ≈ 0.66, and θ = 1.''978, and SDSS J1515+1511 with z<SUB>s</SUB> = 2.054, z<SUB>l</SUB> = 0.742, and θ = 1.''989. It is difficult to estimate the lens redshift of SDSS J1128+2402 from the current data. Two of the four systems (SDSS J1405+0959 and SDSS J1515+1511) are included in our final statistical lens sample to derive constraints on dark energy and the evolution of massive galaxies.

N2  - We report on deep near-infrared observations obtained with the Wide Field Camera-3 (WFC3) onboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) of the first five confirmed gravitational lensing events discovered by the Herschel Astrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey (H-ATLAS). We succeed in disentangling the background galaxy from the lens to gain separate photometry of the two components. The HST data allow us to significantly improve on previous constraints of the mass in stars of the lensed galaxy and to perform accurate lens modelling of these systems, as described in the accompanying paper by Dye et al. We fit the spectral energy distributions of the background sources from near-IR to millimetre wavelengths and use the magnification factors estimated by Dye et al. to derive the intrinsic properties of the lensed galaxies. We find these galaxies to have star-formations rates (SFR) ∼ 400-2000 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, with ∼(6-25) × 10<SUP>10</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB> of their baryonic mass already turned into stars. At these rates of star formation, all remaining molecular gas will be exhausted in less than ∼100 Myr, reaching a final mass in stars of a few 10<SUP>11</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. These galaxies are thus proto-ellipticals caught during their major episode of star formation, and observed at the peak epoch (z ∼ 1.5-3) of the cosmic star formation history of the Universe.

N2  - We have determined the mass density radial profiles of the first five strong gravitational lens systems discovered by the Herschel Astrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey. We present an enhancement of the semilinear lens inversion method of Warren & Dye which allows simultaneous reconstruction of several different wavebands and apply this to dual-band imaging of the lenses acquired with the Hubble Space Telescope. The five systems analysed here have lens redshifts which span a range 0.22 ≤ z ≤ 0.94. Our findings are consistent with other studies by concluding that: (1) the logarithmic slope of the total mass density profile steepens with decreasing redshift; (2) the slope is positively correlated with the average total projected mass density of the lens contained within half the effective radius and negatively correlated with the effective radius; (3) the fraction of dark matter contained within half the effective radius increases with increasing effective radius and increases with redshift.

N2  - Context. The recent discovery of a large number of galaxy clusters using the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect has opened a new era on the study of the most massive clusters in the Universe. Multiwavelength analyses are required to understand the properties of these new sets of clusters, which are a sensitive probe of cosmology. <BR /> Aims: We aim for a multiwavelength characterization of PLCK G004.5-19.5, one of the most massive X-ray validated SZ effect-selected galaxy clusters discovered by the Planck satellite. <BR /> Methods: We have observed PLCK G004.5-19.5 with GMOS on the 8.1 m-Gemini South Telescope for optical imaging and spectroscopy, and performed a strong lensing analysis. We also searched for associated radio emission in published catalogs. <BR /> Results: An analysis of the optical images confirms that this is a massive cluster, with a dominant central galaxy and an accompanying red sequence of galaxies, plus a 14″-long strong lensing arc. Longslit spectroscopy of six cluster members shows that the cluster is at z = 0.516 ± 0.002. We also targeted the strongly lensed arc, and found z<SUB>arc</SUB> = 1.601. We use LensTool to carry out a strong lensing analysis, from which we measure a median Einstein radius θ<SUB>E</SUB>(z<SUB>s</SUB> = 1.6) ≃ 30″ and estimate an enclosed mass M<SUB>E</SUB> = 2.45<SUB>-0.47</SUB><SUP>+0.45</SUP> × 10<SUP>14</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. By extrapolating a Navarro-Frenk-White profile, we find a total mass M<SUB>500</SUB><SUP>SL</SUP> = 4.0<SUB>-1.0</SUB><SUP>+2.1</SUP> × 10<SUP>14</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. We also include a constraint on the mass from previous X-ray observations, which yields a slightly higher mass, M<SUB>500</SUB><SUP>SL+X</SUP> = 6.7<SUB>-1.3</SUB><SUP>+2.6</SUP> × 10<SUP>14</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, consistent with the value from strong lensing alone. Intermediate-resolution radio images from the TIFR GMRT Sky Survey at 150 MHz reveal that PLCK G004.5-19.5 hosts a powerful radio relic on scales ≲500 kpc. Emission at the same location is also detected in low-resolution images at 843 MHz and 1.4 GHz. This is one of the higher redshift radio relics known to date. <P />Based on observations obtained at the Gemini Observatory, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under a cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation (NSF) on behalf of the Gemini partnership: the NSF (United States), the Science and Technology Facilities Council (United Kingdom), the National Research Council (Canada), Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica (CONICYT, Chile), the Australian Research Council (Australia), Ministério da Ciência, Tecnologia e Inovação (Brazil), and Ministerio de Ciencia, Tecnología e Innovación Productiva (Argentina).

N2  - We present a quintuply lensed z ∼ 6 candidate discovered in the field of the galaxy cluster RXC J2248.7-4431 (z ∼ 0.348) targeted within the Cluster Lensing and Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH) and selected in the deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) frontier fields survey. Thanks to the CLASH 16-band HST imaging, we identify the quintuply lensed z ∼ 6 candidate as an optical dropout in the inner region of the cluster, the brightest image having mag<SUB>AB</SUB> = 24.8 ± 0.1 in the f105w filter. We perform a detailed photometric analysis to verify its high-z and lensed nature. We get as photometric redshift z<SUB>ph</SUB> ∼ 5.9, and given the extended nature and NIR colours of the lensed images, we rule out low-z early-type and galactic star contaminants. We perform a strong lensing analysis of the cluster, using 13 families of multiple lensed images identified in the HST images. Our final best model predicts the high-z quintuply lensed system with a position accuracy of 0.8 arcsec. The magnifications of the five images are between 2.2 and 8.3, which leads to a delensed UV luminosity of L_{1600}∼ 0.5L_{1600}^* at z = 6. We also estimate the UV slope from the observed NIR colours, finding a steep β = -2.89 ± 0.38. We use singular and composite stellar population SEDs to fit the photometry of the high-z candidate, and we conclude that it is a young (age <300 Myr) galaxy with mass of M ∼ 10<SUP>8</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, subsolar metallicity (Z < 0.2 Z<SUB>⊙</SUB>) and low dust content (A<SUB>V</SUB> ∼ 0.2-0.4).

N2  - We present VIsible Multi-Object Spectrograph (VIMOS) observations of a galaxy quintuply imaged by the Frontier Fields galaxy cluster RXC J2248.7-4431 . This sub-, high- galaxy has been recently discovered by Monna et al. (2013) using dropout techniques with the 16-band HST photometry acquired as part of the Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH). Obtained as part of the CLASH-VLT survey, the VIMOS medium-resolution spectra of this source show a very faint continuum between 8700 Å and 9300 Å and a prominent emission line at 8643 , which can be readily identified with Lyman- at . The emission line exhibits an asymmetric profile, with a more pronounced red wing. The rest-frame equivalent width of the line is , relatively well constrained thanks to the detection of the UV continuum, which is rarely achieved for a sub- galaxy at this redshift. After correcting formagnification, the star formation rate (SFR) estimated from the Ly line is SFRLyyr and that estimated from the UV data is SFRUVyr. We estimate that the effective radius of the source is kpc, which implies a star formation surface mass density yrkpc and, using the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, a gas surface mass density pc. Our results support the idea that this magnified, distant galaxy is a young and compact object with luminosity at , when the Universe was just 1 Gyr old, with a similar amount of mass in gas and stars. In the spirit of the Frontier Fields initiative, we also publish the redshifts of several multiply imaged sources and other background objects, which will help improving the strong-lensing model of this galaxy cluster. <P />This work is based on data collected at ESO VLT (prog.ID 186.A-0798) and at NASA HST.

N2  - Using spectroscopy from the Large Binocular Telescope and imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope we discovered the first strong galaxy lens at z <SUB>lens</SUB> > 1. The lens has a secure photometric redshift of z = 1.53 ± 0.09 and the source is spectroscopically confirmed at z = 3.417. The Einstein radius (0.''35; 3.0 kpc) encloses 7.6 × 10<SUP>10</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, with an upper limit on the dark matter fraction of 60%. The highly magnified (40×) source galaxy has a very small stellar mass (~10<SUP>8</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB>) and shows an extremely strong [O III]<SUB>5007 Å</SUB> emission line (EW<SUB>0</SUB> ~ 1000 Å) bolstering the evidence that intense starbursts among very low-mass galaxies are common at high redshift.

N2  - In this thesis we study a population of gravitationally lensed, extremely distant, dusty, star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) discovered in large area millimetre surveys. This work is a collection of theoretical and observational studies which shed light on different aspects of this population, and pave the way for future use of these sources to study galaxy formation at high-redshift, dark matter, and dark energy. Two chapters of this work study the statistical properties of this population, demonstrating that i) the existence of extremely bright, high-redshift galaxies in millimetre and submillimetre surveys can be understood in the context of gravitational lensing of high-redshift sources by intervening structures along the line-of-sight, and ii) statistical lensing models allow us to understand the selection effects and statistical biases of this sample, which are crucial for a correct interpretation of the underlying source population. This thesis also studies how the lensing of high redshift sources modifies the statistics of the background radiation, resulting in a biased measurement of dark energy parameters using Sunyaev-Zel'dovich cluster detection experiments, such as the South Pole Telescope. The simulations presented in this work allow us to correct for this effect. We then present high resolution Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations of four of the sources in this sample, unambiguously confirming that these sources are gravitationally lensed by intervening galaxies. We develop a lens modeling technique appropriate for interferometric data and apply it to the ALMA observations to derive the lensing magnification, allowing the calculation of the intrinsic (unlensed) properties of the DSFGs. Finally, we study the prospects for detecting low-mass dark matter subhalos embedded in the halos of the lensing galaxies through their gravitational effects on the images of the background DSFGs. We show that by taking advantage of the spectral resolution of ALMA, it may be possible to detect dark matter halos with masses as low as 10^8 Msun.

N2  - We report the discovery of a pair of quasars at z = 1.487, with a separation of 8.''585 ± 0.''002. Subaru Telescope infrared imaging reveals the presence of an elliptical and a disk-like galaxy located almost symmetrically between the quasars, in a cross-like configuration. Based on absorption lines in the quasar spectra and the colors of the galaxies, we estimate that both galaxies are located at redshift z = 0.899. This, as well as the similarity of the quasar spectra, suggests that the system is a single quasar multiply imaged by a galaxy group or cluster acting as a gravitational lens, although the possibility of a binary quasar cannot be fully excluded. We show that the gravitational lensing hypothesis implies that these galaxies are not isolated, but must be embedded in a dark matter halo of virial mass ~4 × 10<SUP>14</SUP> h <SUP>-1</SUP> <SUB>70</SUB> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> assuming a Navarro-Frenk-White model with a concentration parameter of c <SUB>vir</SUB> = 6, or a singular isothermal sphere profile with a velocity dispersion of ~670 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. We place constraints on the location of the dark matter halo, as well as the velocity dispersions of the galaxies. In addition, we discuss the influence of differential reddening, microlensing, and intrinsic variability on the quasar spectra and broadband photometry. <P />Based on data collected at Subaru Telescope, which is operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan. Use of the UH2.2 m telescope for the observations is supported by NAOJ.

N2  - We present a candidate for the most distant galaxy known to date with a photometric redshift of z = 10.7<SUP>+0.6</SUP> <SUB>-0.4</SUB> (95% confidence limits; with z < 9.5 galaxies of known types ruled out at 7.2σ). This J-dropout Lyman break galaxy, named MACS0647-JD, was discovered as part of the Cluster Lensing and Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH). We observe three magnified images of this galaxy due to strong gravitational lensing by the galaxy cluster MACSJ0647.7+7015 at z = 0.591. The images are magnified by factors of ~80, 7, and 2, with the brighter two observed at ~26th magnitude AB (~0.15 μJy) in the WFC3/IR F160W filter (~1.4-1.7 μm) where they are detected at gsim12σ. All three images are also confidently detected at gsim6σ in F140W (~1.2-1.6 μm), dropping out of detection from 15 lower wavelength Hubble Space Telescope filters (~0.2-1.4 μm), and lacking bright detections in Spitzer/IRAC 3.6 μm and 4.5 μm imaging (~3.2-5.0 μm). We rule out a broad range of possible lower redshift interlopers, including some previously published as high-redshift candidates. Our high-redshift conclusion is more conservative than if we had neglected a Bayesian photometric redshift prior. Given CLASH observations of 17 high-mass clusters to date, our discoveries of MACS0647-JD at z ~ 10.8 and MACS1149-JD at z ~ 9.6 are consistent with a lensed luminosity function extrapolated from lower redshifts. This would suggest that low-luminosity galaxies could have reionized the universe. However, given the significant uncertainties based on only two galaxies, we cannot yet rule out the sharp drop-off in number counts at z >~ 10 suggested by field searches.

N2  - We report the discovery by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) of the z = 2.452 source WISE J181417.29+341224.9, the first hyperluminous source found in the WISE survey. WISE 1814+3412 is also the prototype for an all-sky sample of ~1000 extremely luminous "W1W2-dropouts" (sources faint or undetected by WISE at 3.4 and 4.6 μm and well detected at 12 or 22 μm). The WISE data and a 350 μm detection give a minimum bolometric luminosity of 3.7 × 10<SUP>13</SUP> L <SUB>⊙</SUB>, with ~10<SUP>14</SUP> L <SUB>⊙</SUB> plausible. Follow-up images reveal four nearby sources: a QSO and two Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) at z = 2.45, and an M dwarf star. The brighter LBG dominates the bolometric emission. Gravitational lensing is unlikely given the source locations and their different spectra and colors. The dominant LBG spectrum indicates a star formation rate ~300 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, accounting for <~ 10% of the bolometric luminosity. Strong 22 μm emission relative to 350 μm implies that warm dust contributes significantly to the luminosity, while cooler dust normally associated with starbursts is constrained by an upper limit at 1.1 mm. Radio emission is ~10 times above the far-infrared/radio correlation, indicating an active galactic nucleus (AGN) is present. An obscured AGN combined with starburst and evolved stellar components can account for the observations. If the black hole mass follows the local M <SUB>BH</SUB>-bulge mass relation, the implied Eddington ratio is >~ 4. WISE 1814+3412 may be a heavily obscured object where the peak AGN activity occurred prior to the peak era of star formation.

N2  - We present gravitational lens models for 20 strong gravitational lens systems observed as part of the Sloan WFC Edge-on Late-type Lens Survey (SWELLS) project. 15 of the lenses are taken from Paper I, while five are newly discovered systems. The systems are galaxy-galaxy lenses where the foreground deflector has an inclined disc, with a wide range of morphological types, from late-type spiral to lenticular. For each system, we compare the total mass inside the critical curve inferred from gravitational lens modelling to the stellar mass inferred from stellar population synthesis (SPS) models, computing the stellar mass fraction f*≡M<SUB>SPS</SUB>/M<SUB>lens</SUB>. We find that, for the lower mass SWELLS systems, adoption of a Salpeter stellar initial mass function (IMF) leads to estimates of f* that exceed 1. This is unphysical and provides strong evidence against the Salpeter IMF being valid for these systems. Taking the lower mass end of the SWELLS sample (σ<SUB>SIE</SUB> < 230 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>), we find that the IMF is lighter (in terms of stellar mass-to-light ratio) than Salpeter with 98 per cent probability, and consistent with the Chabrier IMF and IMFs between the two. This result is consistent with previous studies of spiral galaxies based on independent techniques. In combination with recent studies of massive early-type galaxies that have favoured a heavier Salpeter-like IMF, this result strengthens the evidence against a universal stellar IMF.

N2  - We report the discovery of three new cases of quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) acting as strong gravitational lenses on background emission line galaxies: SDSS J0827+5224 (z<SUB>QSO</SUB> = 0.293, z<SUB>s</SUB> = 0.412), SDSS J0919+2720 (z<SUB>QSO</SUB> = 0.209, z<SUB>s</SUB> = 0.558), SDSS J1005+4016 (z<SUB>QSO</SUB> = 0.230, z<SUB>s</SUB> = 0.441). The selection was carried out using a sample of 22,298 SDSS spectra displaying at least four emission lines at a redshift beyond that of the foreground QSO. The lensing nature is confirmed from Keck imaging and spectroscopy, as well as from HST/WFC3 imaging in the F475W and F814W filters. Two of the QSOs have face-on spiral host galaxies and the third is a QSO+galaxy pair. The velocity dispersion of the host galaxies, inferred from simple lens modeling, is between σ = 210 and 285 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, making these host galaxies comparable in mass with the SLACS sample of early-type strong lenses. <P />Based on data obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation. Also based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.

N2  - We present the Strong Lensing Legacy Survey-ARCS (SARCS) sample compiled from the final T0006 data release of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS) covering a total non-overlapping area of 159 deg<SUP>2</SUP>. We adopt a semi-automatic method to find gravitational arcs in the survey that makes use of an arc-finding algorithm. The candidate list is pruned by visual inspection and ranking to form the final SARCS sample. This list also includes some serendipitously discovered lens candidates which the automated algorithm did not detect. The SARCS sample consists of 127 lens candidates which span arc radii ~2''-18'' within the unmasked area of ~150 deg<SUP>2</SUP>. Within the sample, 54 systems are promising lenses among which, we find 12 giant arcs (length-to-width ratio >=8). We also find two radial arc candidates in SL2SJ141447+544704. From our sample, we detect a systematic alignment of the giant arcs with the major axis of the baryonic component of the putative lens in concordance with previous studies. This alignment is also observed for all arcs in the sample and does not vary significantly with increasing arc radius. The mean values of the photometric redshift distributions of lenses corresponding to the giant arcs and all arcs sample are at z ~ 0.6. Owing to the large area and depth of the CFHTLS, we find the largest sample of lenses probing mass scales that are intermediate to cluster and galaxy lenses for the first time. We compare the observed image separation distribution (ISD) of our arcs with theoretical models. A two-component density profile for the lenses which accounts for both the central galaxy and the dark matter component is required by the data to explain the observed ISD. Unfortunately, current levels of uncertainties and degeneracies accommodate models both with and without adiabatic contraction. We also show the effects of changing parameters of the model that predict the ISD and that a larger lens sample might constrain relations such as the concentration-mass relation, mass-luminosity relation, and the faint-end slope of the luminosity function. <P />Based on observations obtained with MegaPrime/MegaCam, a joint project of CFHT and CEA/DAPNIA, at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) which is operated by the National Research Council (NRC) of Canada, the Institut National des Science de l'Univers of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) of France, and the University of Hawaii. This work is based in part on data products produced at TERAPIX and the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre as part of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey, a collaborative project of NRC and CNRS.

N2  - We report the discovery of seven strongly lensed Lyman-break galaxy (LBG) candidates at z ~ 7 detected in Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) imaging of A1703. The brightest candidate, called A1703-zD1, has an observed (lensed) magnitude of 24.0 AB (26σ) in the WFC3/IR F160W band, making it 0.2 mag brighter than the z <SUB>850</SUB>-dropout candidate recently reported behind the Bullet Cluster and 0.7 mag brighter than the previously brightest known z ~ 7.6 galaxy, A1689-zD1. With a cluster magnification of ~9, this source has an intrinsic magnitude of H <SUB>160</SUB> = 26.4 AB, a strong z <SUB>850</SUB> - J <SUB>125</SUB> break of 1.7 mag, and a photometric redshift of z ~ 6.7. Additionally, we find six other bright LBG candidates with H <SUB>160</SUB>-band magnitudes of 24.9-26.4, photometric redshifts z ~ 6.4 - 8.8, and magnifications μ ~ 3-40. Stellar population fits to the Advanced Camera for Surveys, WFC3/IR, and Spitzer/Infrared Array Camera data for A1703-zD1 and A1703-zD4 yield stellar masses (0.7 - 3.0) × 10<SUP>9</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, stellar ages 5-180 Myr, and star formation rates ~7.8 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, and low reddening with A<SUB>V</SUB> <= 0.7. The source-plane reconstruction of the exceptionally bright candidate A1703-zD1 exhibits an extended structure, spanning ~4 kpc in the z ~ 6.7 source plane, and shows three resolved star-forming knots of radius r ~ 0.4 kpc. <P />Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy under NASA contract NAS5-26555.

N2  - We report the discovery of a z <SUB>phot</SUB> = 6.18<SUP>+0.05</SUP> <SUB>- 0.07</SUB> (95% confidence level) dwarf galaxy, lensed into four images by the galaxy cluster MACS J0329.6-0211 (z<SUB>l</SUB> = 0.45). The galaxy is observed as a high-redshift dropout in HST/ACS/WFC3 CLASH and Spitzer/IRAC imaging. Its redshift is securely determined due to a clear detection of the Lyman break in the 18-band photometry, making this galaxy one of the highest-redshift multiply lensed objects known to date with an observed magnitude of F125W =24.00 ± 0.04 AB mag for its most magnified image. We also present the first strong-lensing analysis of this cluster uncovering 15 additional multiply imaged candidates of five lower-redshift sources spanning the range z<SUB>s</SUB> ~= 2-4. The mass model independently supports the high photometric redshift and reveals magnifications of 11.6<SUP>+8.9</SUP> <SUB>- 4.1</SUB>, 17.6<SUP>+6.2</SUP> <SUB>- 3.9</SUB>, 3.9<SUP>+3.0</SUP> <SUB>- 1.7</SUB>, and 3.7<SUP>+1.3</SUP> <SUB>- 0.2</SUB>, respectively, for the four images of the high-redshift galaxy. By delensing the most magnified image we construct an image of the source with a physical resolution of ~200 pc when the universe was ~0.9 Gyr old, where the z ~= 6.2 galaxy occupies a source-plane area of approximately 2.2 kpc<SUP>2</SUP>. Modeling the observed spectral energy distribution using population synthesis models, we find a demagnified stellar mass of ∼10^{9} {M}_{⊙}, subsolar metallicity (Z/Z <SUB>⊙</SUB> ~ 0.5), low dust content (A<SUB>V</SUB> ~ 0.1 mag), a demagnified star formation rate (SFR) of ∼3.2 {M}_{⊙} yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, and a specific SFR of ~3.4 Gyr<SUP>-1</SUP>, all consistent with the properties of local dwarf galaxies.

N2  - Gravitational lens systems containing lensed quasars are important as cosmological probes, as diagnostics of structural properties of the lensing galaxies and as tools to study the quasars themselves. The largest lensed quasar sample is the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Quasar Lens Search (SQLS), drawn from the SDSS. We attempt to extend this survey using observations of lens candidates selected from a combination of the quasar sample from the SDSS and the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS). This adds somewhat higher image quality together with a wider range of wavelength for the selection process. In previous pilot surveys we observed five objects, finding two lenses; here we present further observations of 20 objects in which we find four lenses, of which two are independently discovered in SQLS. Following earlier work on the combination of these two surveys, we have refined our method and find that use of a colour-separation diagnostic, where we select for separations between components which appear to decrease in wavelength, is an efficient method to find lensed quasars and may be useful in ongoing and future large-scale strong lensing surveys with instruments such as Pan-STARRS and LSST. The new lenses have mostly high flux ratios, with faint secondaries buried in the lensing galaxy and typically 6-10 times less bright than the primary. Our survey brings the total number of lenses discovered in the SDSS quasar sample to 46, plus 13 lenses already known. This is likely to be up to 60-70 per cent of the total number of lensed quasars; we briefly discuss strategies by which the rest might be found.

N2  - We present a catalog of 25 definite and 11 probable strong galaxy-galaxy gravitational lens systems with lens redshifts 0.4 <~ z <~ 0.7, discovered spectroscopically by the presence of higher-redshift emission lines within the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) of luminous galaxies, and confirmed with high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images of 44 candidates. Our survey extends the methodology of the Sloan Lens Advanced Camera for Surveys survey (SLACS) to higher redshift. We describe the details of the BOSS spectroscopic candidate detections, our HST ACS image processing and analysis methods, and our strong gravitational lens modeling procedure. We report BOSS spectroscopic parameters and ACS photometric parameters for all candidates, and mass-distribution parameters for the best-fit singular isothermal ellipsoid models of definite lenses. Our sample to date was selected using only the first six months of BOSS survey-quality spectroscopic data. The full five-year BOSS database should produce a sample of several hundred strong galaxy-galaxy lenses and in combination with SLACS lenses at lower redshift, strongly constrain the redshift evolution of the structure of elliptical, bulge-dominated galaxies as a function of luminosity, stellar mass, and rest-frame color, thereby providing a powerful test for competing theories of galaxy formation and evolution. <P />Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.

N2  - We report on the serendipitous discovery in the Blanco Cosmology Survey (BCS) imaging data of a z = 0.9057 galaxy that is being strongly lensed by a massive galaxy cluster at a redshift of z = 0.3838. The lens (BCS J2352-5452) was discovered while examining i- and z-band images being acquired in 2006 October during a BCS observing run. Follow-up spectroscopic observations with the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph instrument on the Gemini-South 8 m telescope confirmed the lensing nature of this system. Using weak-plus-strong lensing, velocity dispersion, cluster richness N <SUB>200</SUB>, and fitting to a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) cluster mass density profile, we have made three independent estimates of the mass M <SUB>200</SUB> which are all very consistent with each other. The combination of the results from the three methods gives M <SUB>200</SUB> = (5.1 ± 1.3) × 10<SUP>14</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, which is fully consistent with the individual measurements. The final NFW concentration c <SUB>200</SUB> from the combined fit is c <SUB>200</SUB> = 5.4<SUP>+1.4</SUP> <SUB>- 1.1</SUB>. We have compared our measurements of M <SUB>200</SUB> and c <SUB>200</SUB> with predictions for (1) clusters from ΛCDM simulations, (2) lensing-selected clusters from simulations, and (3) a real sample of cluster lenses. We find that we are most compatible with the predictions for ΛCDM simulations for lensing clusters, and we see no evidence based on this one system for an increased concentration compared to ΛCDM. Finally, using the flux measured from the [O II]3727 line we have determined the star formation rate of the source galaxy and find it to be rather modest given the assumed lens magnification.

N2  - The relative contribution of baryons and dark matter to the inner regions of spiral galaxies provides critical clues to their formation and evolution, but it is generally difficult to determine. For spiral galaxies that are strong gravitational lenses, however, the combination of lensing and kinematic observations can be used to break the disc-halo degeneracy. In turn, such data constrain fundamental parameters such as (i) the mass density profile slope and axial ratio of the dark matter halo, and by comparison with dark matter-only numerical simulations the modifications imposed by baryons; (ii) the mass in stars and therefore the overall star formation efficiency, and the amount of feedback; (iii) by comparison with stellar population synthesis models, the normalization of the stellar initial mass function. In this first paper of a series, we present a sample of 16 secure, one probable and six possible strong lensing spiral galaxies, for which multiband high-resolution images and rotation curves were obtained using the Hubble Space Telescope and Keck II telescope as part of the Sloan WFC Edge-on Late-type Lens Survey (SWELLS). The sample includes eight newly discovered secure systems. We characterize the sample of deflector galaxies in terms of their morphologies, structural parameters and stellar masses. We find that the SWELLS sample of secure lenses spans a broad range of morphologies (from lenticular to late-type spiral), spectral types (quantified by Hα emission) and bulge to total stellar mass ratio (0.22-0.85), while being limited to M<SUB>*</SUB> > 10<SUP>10.5</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. The SWELLS sample is thus well suited for exploring the relationship between dark and luminous matter in a broad range of galaxies. We find that the deflector galaxies obey the same size-mass relation as that of a comparison sample of elongated non-lens galaxies selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We conclude that the SWELLS sample is consistent with being representative of the overall population of high-mass high-inclination discy galaxies.

N2  - We report the discovery of a unique z= 6.027 galaxy, multiply imaged by the cluster Abell 383 and detected in new Hubble Space Telescope ACS and WFC3 imaging, as well as in Warm Spitzer observations. This galaxy was selected as a pair of i-dropouts; its suspected high redshift was confirmed by the measurement of a strong Lyman α line in both images using Keck/DEIMOS. Combining Hubble and Spitzer photometry after correcting for contamination by line emission (estimated to be a small effect), we identify a strong Balmer break of 1.5 mag. Taking into account the magnification factor of 11.4 ± 1.9 (2.65 ± 0.17 mag) for the brightest image, the unlensed AB magnitude for the source is 27.2 ± 0.05 in the H band, corresponding to a 0.4 L* galaxy, and 25.7 ± 0.08 at 3.6 μm. The UV slope is consistent with β∼ 2.0, and from the rest-frame UV continuum we measure a current star formation rate of 2.4 ± 1.1 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. The unlensed half-light radius is measured to be 300 pc, from which we deduce a star-forming surface density of ∼10 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> kpc<SUP>-2</SUP>. The Lyman α emission is found to be extended over ∼3 arcsec along the slit, corresponding to ∼5 kpc in the source plane. This can be explained by the presence of a much larger envelope of neutral hydrogen around the star-forming region. Finally, fitting the spectral energy distribution (SED) using seven photometric data points with simple SED models, we derive the following properties: very little reddening, an inferred stellar mass of M*= 6 × 10<SUP>9</SUP> M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, and an inferred age of ∼800 Myr (corresponding to a redshift of formation of ∼18). The star formation rate of this object was likely much stronger in the past than at the time of observation, suggesting that we may be missing a fraction of galaxies at z∼ 6 which have already faded in rest-frame UV wavelengths.

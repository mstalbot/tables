        <abstract>We report on the serendipitous discovery of the brightest Lyman break galaxy (LBG) currently known, a galaxy at z=2.73 that is being strongly lensed by the z=0.38 luminous red galaxy (LRG) SDSS J002240.91+143110.4. The arc of this gravitational lens system, which we have dubbed the ''8 o'clock arc'' due to its time of discovery, was initially identified in the imaging data of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 4; followup observations on the Astrophysical Research Consortium (ARC) 3.5 m telescope at Apache Point Observatory confirmed the lensing nature of this system and led to the identification of the arc's spectrum as that of an LBG. The arc has a spectrum and a redshift remarkably similar to those of the previous record-holder for brightest LBG (MS 1512-cB58, also known as cB58), but, with an estimated total magnitude of (g, r, i)=(20.0, 19.2, 19.0) and surface brightness of (mu_g, mu_r, mu_i)=(23.3, 22.5, 22.3) mag arcsec^-2, the 8 o'clock arc is thrice as bright. The 8 o'clock arc, which consists of three lensed images of the LBG, is 162Â° (9.6'') long and has a length-to-width ratio of 6:1. A fourth image of the LBG-a counterimage-can also be identified in the ARC 3.5 m g-band images. A simple lens model for the system assuming a singular isothermal ellipsoid yields an Einstein radius of thetas_Ein=3.32^''Â±0.16^'', a total mass for the lensing LRG (within the 12.1Â±0.6 h^-1 kpc enclosed by the Einstein radius) of 1.35\times10^12 h^-1M_solar, and a magnification factor for the LBG of 12.3^+15.0_-3.6. The LBG itself is intrinsically quite luminous (~11L_*) and shows indications of massive recent star formation, perhaps as high as 160 h^-1 M_solar yr^-1.</abstract>

        <abstract>Context: Gravitational lenses offer unique opportunities to explore the molecular content around active galactic nuclei at high redshift, through the magnification and gain in angular resolution. &lt;BR /&gt;Aims: We study here the molecular and dust content of the high redshift (z=3.2), gravitationally lensed quasar MG0751+2716. &lt;BR /&gt;Methods: We used the IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer to measure the CO J=3-2, J=4-3 and J=8-7 rotation lines and continuum flux between 1.1 mm and 3 mm in MG0751+2716. We use HST data and constraints from the high resolution MERLIN map at 6.2 cm to build an improved model of the lens. &lt;BR /&gt;Results: The position agreement between the CO emission and the millimeter continuum suggests that dust and molecules are closely related. A 500 km s^-1 velocity gradient is tentatively detected from the CO lines across the central 0.5''. The continuum SED in the range 0.45 mm-204 mm exhibits the signatures of two components: synchrotron emission from a core/jet system, and thermal emission related to warm dust. The CO line intensities are compatible with warm, dense molecular gas, suggesting a location in the close environment of the quasar. These observational constraints lead us to consider a source/quasar model made of a point-like core, a radio jet, and a molecular and dusty ring-like structure (~460 pc in radius) located in a plane perpendicular to the jet axis and seen almost edge-on. For this configuration, we derive a total magnification of 16 for the quasar radiation at rest frequency above 350 GHz and a magnification of 25 below 350 GHz. The dust mass (assuming a likely temperature T=50 K) is M\_dust=1.7 \times 10^8 M\_\sun, the mass of molecular material is M(H\_2) = 6 \times 10^10 M\_\sun and a lower limit to the dynamical mass is M\_dyn = 1.5 \times 10^10 M\_\sun. Such values are comparable to those found in the small sample of CO detected sources at high redshifts. Based on observations carried out with the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer. IRAM is supported by INSU/CNRS (France), MPG (Germany) and IGN (Spain). Based on observations obtained with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained from the data archive at the Space Telescope Science Institute.

        <abstract>Context: Strong lens candidates have been newly identified within the COSMOS field. We present VLT/FORS1 spectroscopic follow-up observations and HST/WFPC2 imaging of the system COSMOS 5921+0638, which exhibits quadruply lensed images and a perfect Einstein ring. 
Aims: We investigate the nature of COSMOS 5921+0638 by studying its photometric, spectroscopic and physical properties. 
Methods: By analyzing our VLT/FORS1 spectroscopy and Subaru/CFHT/HST imaging of COSMOS 5921+0638, we completed both an environmental analysis and detailed analytical and grid-based mass modeling to determine it properties. 
Results: We measured the redshifts of the lensing galaxy in COSMOS 5921+0638 (z_l = 0.551 plusmn 0.001) and 9 additional galaxies in the field (5 of them at z ~ 0.35). The redshift of the lensed source was inferred by identifying a candidate Lyalpha line at z_s = 3.14 plusmn 0.05. The mass modeling reveals the requirement of a small external shear (gamma = 0.038), which is slightly larger than the lensing contribution expected by galaxy groups along the line-of-sight obtained from the zCOSMOS optical group catalog (kappa_groups ~ 0.01 and gamma_groups ~ 0.005). The estimated time-delays between the different images are of the order of hours to half a week and the total magnification of the background source is mu ap 150. The measured mass-to-light ratio of the lensing galaxy within the Einstein ring is M/L_B ap 8.5 plusmn 1.6. Anomalies are observed between the measured and expected flux ratios of the images of the background AGN.
Conclusions: Our analysis indicates that the ring and point-like structures in COSMOS 5921+0638 consist of a lensed high redshift galaxy hosting a low luminosity AGN (LLAGN). The observed flux ratio anomalies are probably due to microlensing by stars in the lensing galaxy and/or a combination of static phenomena. Multi-epoch, multi-band space-based observations would allow us to differentiate between the possible causes of these anomalies, since static and/or dynamic variations could be identified. Because of its short time-delays and the possibility of microlensing, COSMOS 5921+0638 is a promising laboratory for future studies of LLAGNs. Based on observations made with ESO Telescopes at Paranal Observatory programme IDs: 077.A-0473(A) and 175.A-0839(B,D) and with NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained from the data archive at the Space Telescope Institute.

        <abstract>Context: Gravitationally lensed quasars constitute an independent tool to derive the Hubble constant through the time-delays of their different images; they offer as well the opportunity to study the mass distribution and interstellar medium of their lensing galaxies and, through microlensing due to stars in their lensing galaxy, they also allow one to study details of the emitting source.
Aims: For such studies, one needs to have an excellent knowledge of the close environment of the lensed images in order to model the lensing potential: this means, ideally, observational data over a large field-of-view and spectroscopy at high spatial resolution.
Methods: We present VIMOS integral field observations of 27Â´Â´ Ã 27Â´Â´ fields of view around four lensed quasars: HE 0230-2130, RX J0911.4 + 0551, H 1413 + 117 and B 1359 + 154. Using the low, medium and high resolution modes, we study the quasar images and the quasar environments. Because of the complexity of the reduction of integral field datasets, we provide a detailed report of the data reduction.
Results: Comparison between the quasar spectra of the different images reveals differences for HE 0230-2130, RX J0911.4 + 0551 and H 1413+117: flux ratios between the images of the same quasar are different when measured in the emission lines and in the continuum. We have also measured the redshifts of galaxies in the neighborhood of HE 0230-2130 and RX J0911.4 + 0551 which possibly contribute to the total lensing potential, given their close proximity to the line-of-sight toward the quasars.
Conclusions: A careful analysis reveals that microlensing is the most natural explanation for the (de)magnification of the continuum emitting region of the background sources. In HE 0230-2130, image D is likely to be affected by microlensing magnification; in RX J0911.4+0551, images A1 and A3 are likely to be modified by microlensing de-magnification and in H 1413+117, at least image D is affected by microlensing. We have not been able to recover any microlensing information or galaxies close to the line-of-sight in the neighborhood of B 1359+154.</abstract>

        <abstract>A new two-image gravitational lens system has been discovered as a result of the Cosmic Lens All-Sky Survey. Radio observations with the Very Large Array (VLA), the MultiElement Radio Linked Interferometer Network and the Very Long Baseline Array at increasingly higher resolutions all show two components with a flux density ratio of ~7 : 1 and a separation of 1.34 arcsec. Both components are compact and have the same spectral index. Follow-up observations made with the VLA at 8.4 GHz show evidence of a feature to the south-east of the brighter component and a corresponding extension of the weaker component to the north-west. Optical observations with the William Herschel Telescope show ~1.7-arcsec extended emission aligned in approximately the same direction as the separation between the radio components with an R-band magnitude of 21.8 Â± 0.4.</abstract>

        <abstract>Using a sample of high-redshift lensed quasars from the CASTLES project with observed-frame ultraviolet or optical and near-infrared spectra, we have searched for possible biases between supermassive black hole (BH) mass estimates based on the C IV, Halpha, and Hbeta broad emission lines. Our sample is based upon that of Greene, Peng, amp Ludwig, expanded with new near-IR spectroscopic observations, consistently analyzed high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) optical spectra, and consistent continuum luminosity estimates at 5100 AA. We find that BH mass estimates based on the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of C IV show a systematic offset with respect to those obtained from the line dispersion, sigma_ l , of the same emission line, but not with those obtained from the FWHM of Halpha and Hbeta. The magnitude of the offset depends on the treatment of the He II and Fe II emission blended with C IV, but there is little scatter for any fixed measurement prescription. While we otherwise find no systematic offsets between C IV and Balmer line mass estimates, we do find that the residuals between them are strongly correlated with the ratio of the UV and optical continuum luminosities. This means that much of the dispersion in previous comparisons of C IV and Hbeta BH mass estimates are due to the continuum luminosities rather than to any properties of the lines. Removing this dependency reduces the scatter between the UV- and optical-based BH mass estimates by a factor of approximately two, from roughly 0.35 to 0.18 dex. The dispersion is smallest when comparing the C IV sigma_ l  mass estimate, after removing the offset from the FWHM estimates, and either Balmer line mass estimate. The correlation with the continuum slope is likely due to a combination of reddening, host contamination, and object-dependent SED shapes. When we add additional heterogeneous measurements from the literature, the results are unchanged. Moreover, in a trial observation of a remaining outlier, the origin of the deviation is clearly due to unrecognized absorption in a low S/N spectrum. This not only highlights the importance of the quality of the observations, but also raises the question whether cases like this one are common in the literature, further biasing comparisons between C IV and other broad emission lines. This work relies partly on observations of the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). The LBT is an international collaboration among institutions in the United States, Italy, and Germany. LBT Corporation partners are The Ohio State University; The University of Arizona on behalf of the Arizona university system; Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica, Italy; LBT Beteiligungsgesellschaft, Germany, representing the Max-Planck Society, the Astrophysical Institute Potsdam, and Heidelberg University; and The Research Corporation, on behalf of The University of Notre Dame, University of Minnesota, and University of Virginia.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report on an investigation of the environments of the Sloan Lens ACS Survey (SLACS) sample of gravitational lenses. The local and global environments of the lenses are characterized using Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) photometry and, when available, spectroscopy. We find that the lens systems that are best modelled with steeper than isothermal density profiles are more likely to have close companions than lenses with shallower than isothermal profiles. This suggests that the profile steepening may be caused by interactions with a companion galaxy as indicated by N-body simulations of group galaxies. The global environments of the SLACS lenses are typical of non-lensing SDSS galaxies with comparable properties to the lenses, and the richnesses of the lens groups are not as strongly correlated with the lens density profiles as are the local environments. Furthermore, we investigate the possibility of line-of-sight contamination affecting the lens models, but do not find a significant over-density of sources compared to lines of sight without lenses.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report on the results of a spectroscopic survey of the environments of the gravitational lens systems CLASS B1600+434 (z_l=0.41,z_s=1.59) and CLASS B2319+051 (z_l=0.62). The B1600+434 system has a time delay measured for it, and we find that the system lies in a group with a velocity dispersion of 90 km s^-1 and at least seven members. B2319+051 has a large group in its immediate foreground with at least 10 members and a velocity dispersion of 460 km s^-1 and another in the background of the lens with a velocity dispersion of 190 km s^-1. These systems increase the sample of spectroscopically confirmed groups associated with strong lenses by 20%. We find that modeling groups as single group-sized halos produces only small corrections (kappa_env,grp~0.01) to lensing models. However, the very local environments, i.e., galaxies within ~15" of the lensing galaxy, have stronger effects on the lens models of the systems studied here. We quantify the effects of the local environment on the lens models and find up to an ~10% correction to the derived value of H_0 for B1600+434 compared to models that do not account for the lens environment.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report on an investigation of the SBS 1520+530 gravitational lens system. We have used archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, Keck spectroscopic data, and Keck adaptive optics (AO) imaging to study the lensing galaxy and its environment. The AO imaging has allowed us to fix the lens galaxy properties with a high degree of accuracy when performing the lens modeling, and the data indicate that the lens has an elliptical morphology and perhaps a disk. The new spectroscopic data suggest that previous determinations of the lens redshift may be incorrect, and we report an updated, although inconclusive, value z_lens=0.761. We have also spectroscopically confirmed the existence of several galaxy groups at approximately the redshift of the lens system. We create new models of the lens system that explicitly account for the environment of the lens, and we also include improved constraints on the lensing galaxy from our AO imaging. Lens models created with these new data can be well fit with a steeper than isothermal mass slope (alpha=2.29, where rho~r^-alpha) if H_0 is fixed at 72 km s^-1 Mpc^-1 isothermal models require H_0~50 km s^-1 Mpc^-1. The steepened profile may indicate that the lens is in a transient perturbed state caused by interactions with a nearby galaxy.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present the current photometric data set for the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) Survey, including Hubble Space Telescope (HST) photometry from Advanced Camera for Surveys, WFPC2, and NICMOS. These data have enabled the confirmation of an additional 15 grade 'A' (certain) lens systems, bringing the number of SLACS grade 'A' lenses to 85; including 13 grade 'B' (likely) systems, SLACS has identified nearly 100 lenses and lens candidates. Approximately 80% of the grade 'A' systems have elliptical morphologies while ~10% show spiral structure; the remaining lenses have lenticular morphologies. Spectroscopic redshifts for the lens and source are available for every system, making SLACS the largest homogeneous data set of galaxy-scale lenses to date. We have created lens models using singular isothermal ellipsoid mass distributions for the 11 new systems that are dominated by a single mass component and where the multiple images are detected with sufficient signal to noise; these models give a high precision measurement of the mass within the Einstein radius of each lens. We have developed a novel Bayesian stellar population analysis code to determine robust stellar masses with accurate error estimates. We apply this code to deep, high-resolution HST imaging and determine stellar masses with typical statistical errors of 0.1 dex; we find that these stellar masses are unbiased compared to estimates obtained using SDSS photometry, provided that informative priors are used. The stellar masses range from 10^10.5 to 10^11.8 M _sun and the typical stellar mass fraction within the Einstein radius is 0.4, assuming a Chabrier initial mass function. The ensemble properties of the SLACS lens galaxies, e.g., stellar masses and projected ellipticities, appear to be indistinguishable from other SDSS galaxies with similar stellar velocity dispersions. This further supports that SLACS lenses are representative of the overall population of massive early-type galaxies with M _* gsim 10^11 M _sun, and are therefore an ideal data set to investigate the kpc-scale distribution of luminous and dark matter in galaxies out to z ~ 0.5.</abstract>

        <abstract>We use stellar masses, surface photometry, strong-lensing masses, and stellar velocity dispersions (sigma_ e/2) to investigate empirical correlations for the definitive sample of 73 early-type galaxies (ETGs) that are strong gravitational lenses from the SLACS survey. The traditional correlations (fundamental plane (FP) and its projections) are consistent with those found for non-lens galaxies, supporting the thesis that SLACS lens galaxies are representative of massive ETGs (dimensional mass M _dim = 10^11-10^12 M _sun). The addition of high-precision strong-lensing estimates of the total mass allows us to gain further insights into their internal structure: (1) the average slope of the total mass-density profile ( rho_totprop r^-gamma') is langgamma'rang = 2.078 Â± 0.027 with an intrinsic scatter of 0.16 Â± 0.02; (2) gamma' correlates with effective radius (r_e ) and central mass density, in the sense that denser galaxies have steeper profiles; (3) the dark matter (DM) fraction within r_e /2 is a monotonically increasing function of galaxy mass and size (due to a mass-dependent central cold DM distribution or due to baryonic DMmdashstellar remnants or low-mass starsmdashif the initial mass function is non-universal and its normalization increases with mass); (4) the dimensional mass M _dim equiv 5r_e sigma^2 _ e/2/G is proportional to the total (lensing) mass M__e/2, and both increase more rapidly than stellar mass M _* (M _* prop M\__e/2**.8); (5) the mass plane (MP), obtained by replacing surface brightness with surface mass density in the FP, is found to be tighter and closer to the virial relation than the FP and the M_*P, indicating that the scatter of those relations is dominated by stellar population effects; (6) we construct the fundamental hyper-plane by adding stellar masses to the MP and find the M _* coefficient to be consistent with zero and no residual intrinsic scatter. Our results demonstrate that the dynamical structure of ETGs is not scale invariant and that it is fully specified by M __e/2, r_e , and sigma_ e/2. Although the basic trends can be explained qualitatively in terms of varying star formation efficiency as a function of halo mass and as the result of dry and wet mergers, reproducing quantitatively the observed correlations and their tightness may be a significant challenge for galaxy formation models.</abstract>

        <abstract>We use Keck laser guide star adaptive optics imaging and exploit the magnifying effects of strong gravitational lensing (the effective resolution is FWHM \\ap 200 pc) to investigate the sub-kpc scale of an intermediate-redshift (z= 0.63), massive early-type galaxy being lensed by a foreground early-type galaxy; we dub this class of strong gravitational lens systems EELs, i.e. early-type/early-type lenses. We find that the background source is massive (M_*= 10^10.9 M_â) and compact (r_e= 1.1 kpc), and a two-component fit is required to model accurately the surface brightness distribution, including an extended low-surface-brightness component. This extended component may arise from the evolution of higher redshift 'red nuggets' or may already be in place at z\\tilde 2 but is unobservable due to cosmological surface brightness dimming.</abstract>

        <abstract>We have discovered a radio source (B2114+022) with a unique structure during the course of the JVAS gravitational lens survey. VLA, MERLIN, VLBA and MERLIN+EVN radio maps reveal four compact components, in a configuration unlike that of any known lens system, or, for that matter, any of the ~15000 radio sources in the JVAS and CLASS surveys. Three of the components are within 0.3arcsec of each other while the fourth is separated from the group by 2.4arcsec. The widest separation pair of components have similar radio structures and spectra. The other pair also have similar properties. This latter pair have spectra which peak at ~5GHz. Their surface brightnesses are much lower than expected for synchrotron self-absorbed components. Ground-based and Hubble Space Telescope optical observations show two galaxies (z=0.3157 and 0.5883) separated by 1.25arcsec. The lower redshift galaxy has a post-starburst spectrum and lies close to, but not coincident with, the compact group of three radio components. No optical or infrared emission is detected from any of the radio components down to I=25 and H=23. We argue that the most likely explanation of the B2114+022 system is that the post-starburst galaxy, assisted by the second galaxy, lenses a distant radio source producing the two wide-separation images. The other two radio components are then associated with the post-starburst galaxy. The combination of the angular sizes of these components, their radio spectra and their location with respect to their host galaxy still remains puzzling.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report from follow-up observations of high redshift AGN candidates from the ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS) that RX J0911.4+0551 is a gravitationally lensed QSO with z=2.800. With an X-ray luminosity of L\_X\_=4.10^46^ergs/s it belongs to the X-ray brightest radio quiet QSOs. However, we must point out that the existing observations do not exclude the possibility that other objects inside the error circle are responsible for the X-ray flux, in particular a lensing cluster. Careful image analysis discerned three optical images. The separation between the two brighter components of 0.80'' is below the seeing value during the observations. The fainter component has a distance of 3.1''. The spectra of the brighter joint A, B component and the C component show no measurable differences in continuum and absorption lines. Three strong CIV absorption line systems with W_lambda\_(1549)&amp;gt;1A are visible in the spectra. All three have z&amp;gt;2.3 which makes it improbable that they are caused by the lensing systems. The only spectral difference are larger equivalent widths of the broad emission lines in the brighter QSO components.</abstract>

        <abstract>We investigate the correlation between the mass of a central supermassive black hole (SMBH) and the total gravitational mass of the host galaxy (M _tot). The results are based on 43 galaxy-scale strong gravitational lenses from the Sloan Lens ACS Surveys (SLACS) Survey whose black hole masses were estimated through two scaling relations: the relation between black hole mass and S'ersic index (M _bh-n) and the relation between black hole mass and stellar velocity dispersion (M _bh-sigma_sstarf). We use the enclosed mass within R _200, the radius within which the density profile of the early type galaxy exceeds the critical density of the universe by a factor of 200, determined by gravitational lens models fitted to Hubble Space Telescope imaging data, as a tracer of the total gravitational mass. The best-fit correlation, where M _bh is determined from M _bh-sigma_sstarf relation, is log(M _bh) = (8.18 Â± 0.11) + (1.55 Â± 0.31)(log(M _tot)-13.0) over 2 orders of magnitude in M _bh. From a variety of tests, we find that we cannot reliably infer a connection between M _bh and M _tot from the M _bh-n relation. The M _bh-M _tot relation provides some of the first, direct observational evidence to test the prediction that SMBH properties are determined by the halo properties of the host galaxy.</abstract>

        <abstract>We model an apparent gravitational lens system HDFS 2232509-603243 in the Hubble Deep Field South. The system consists of a blue V=25 mag arc separated by 0.9'' from a red V=22 mag elliptical galaxy. A mass distribution that follows the observed light distribution with a constant mass-to-light ratio can fit the arc component positions if external shear is added. A good fit is also obtained with simple parameterized models, and all the models predict a fourth image that is fainter than the detection limit. The inferred mass-to-light ratio is ~15 in solar units if the lens is at z=0.6. The lens models predict a velocity dispersion of ~280 km s^-1 that could be confirmed with spectroscopy.</abstract>

        <abstract>We combine in a self-consistent way the constraints from both gravitational lensing and stellar kinematics to perform a detailed investigation of the internal mass distribution, amount of dark matter, and dynamical structure of the 16 early-type lens galaxies from the Sloan Lens ACS Survey (SLACS Survey), at z= 0.08-0.33, for which both Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced camera for Surveys and NICMOS high-resolution imaging and Very Large Telescope VIMOS integral-field spectroscopy are available. Based on this data set, we analyse the inner regions of the galaxies, that is, typically within one (three-dimensional) effective radius r_e, under the assumption of axial symmetry and by constructing dynamical models supported by two-integral stellar distribution functions. For all systems, the total mass density distribution is found to be well approximated by a simple power law ? (with m being the ellipsoidal radius): this profile is on average slightly super-isothermal, with a logarithmic slope &lt;gamma'&gt;= 2.074^+0.043_-0.041 (errors indicate the 68 per cent confidence interval) and an intrinsic scatter ?, and is fairly round, with an average axial ratio &lt;q&gt;= 0.77 Â± 0.04. The lower limit for the dark matter fraction (f_DM) inside r_e ranges, in individual systems, from nearly zero to almost a half, with a median value of 12 per cent. By including stellar masses derived from stellar population synthesis models with a Salpeter initial mass function (IMF), we obtain an average f_DM= 31 per cent, and the corresponding stellar profiles are physically acceptable, with the exception of two cases where they only marginally exceed the total mass profile. f_DM rises to 61 per cent if, instead, a Chabrier IMF is assumed. For both IMFs, the dark matter fraction increases with the total mass of the galaxy (correlation significant at the 3sigma level). Based on the intrinsic angular momentum parameter calculated from our models, we find that the galaxies can be divided into two dynamically distinct groups, which are shown to correspond to the usual classes of the (observationally defined) slow and fast rotators. Overall, the SLACS systems are structurally and dynamically very similar to their nearby counterparts, indicating that the inner regions of early-type galaxies have undergone little, if any, evolution since redshift z\ap 0.35.</abstract>

        <abstract>We construct a fully self-consistent mass model for the lens galaxy SDSS J2141 at redshift 0.14, and use it to improve on previous studies by modelling its gravitational lensing effect, gas rotation curve and stellar kinematics simultaneously. We adopt a very flexible axisymmetric mass model constituted by a generalized Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) dark matter halo and a stellar mass distribution obtained by deprojecting the multi-Gaussian expansion fit to the high-resolution K'-band laser guide star adaptive optics imaging data of the galaxy, with the (spatially constant) mass-to-light ratio as a free parameter. We model the stellar kinematics by solving the anisotropic Jeans equations. We find that the inner logarithmic slope of the dark halo is weakly constrained, i.e. ?, and consistent with an unmodified NFW profile; we can conclude, however, that steep profiles (gammaââ¥ 1.5) are disfavoured (&amp;lt;14 per cent posterior probability). We marginalize over this parameter to infer the galaxy to have (i) a dark matter fraction within 2.2 disc radii of ?, independent of the galaxy stellar population, implying a maximal disc for SDSS J2141; (ii) an apparently uncontracted dark matter halo, with concentration ? and virial velocity ?, consistent with Lambda cold dark matter (LambdaCDM) predictions; (iii) a slightly oblate halo (?), consistent with predictions from baryon-affected models. Comparing the tightly constrained gravitational stellar mass inferred from the combined analysis (?) with that inferred from stellar population modelling of the galaxies\rsquo colours, and accounting for an expected cold gas fraction of 20 Â± 10 per cent, we determine a preference for a Chabrier IMF over Salpeter IMF by a Bayes factor of 5.7 (corresponding to substantial evidence). We infer a value ? for the orbital anisotropy parameter in the meridional plane, in agreement with most studies of local disc galaxies, and ruling out at 99 per cent confidence level that the dynamics of this system can be described by a two-integral distribution function.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present results from a spectroscopic program targeting 26 strong-lensing cluster cores that were visually identified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Second Red-Sequence Cluster Survey (RCS-2). The 26 galaxy cluster lenses span a redshift range of 0.2 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 0.65, and our spectroscopy reveals 69 unique background sources with redshifts as high as z = 5.200. We also identify redshifts for 262 cluster member galaxies and measure the velocity dispersions and dynamical masses for 18 clusters where we have redshifts for N &amp;gt;= 10 cluster member galaxies. We account for the expected biases in dynamical masses of strong-lensing-selected clusters as predicted by results from numerical simulations and discuss possible sources of bias in our observations. The median dynamical mass of the 18 clusters with N &amp;gt;= 10 spectroscopic cluster members is M _Vir = 7.84 	imes 10^14 M _sun h ^-1 _0.7, which is somewhat higher than predictions for strong-lensing-selected clusters in simulations. The disagreement is not significant considering the large uncertainty in our dynamical data, systematic uncertainties in the velocity dispersion calibration, and limitations of the theoretical modeling. Nevertheless our study represents an important first step toward characterizing large samples of clusters that are identified in a systematic way as systems exhibiting dramatic strong-lensing features. Based on observations obtained at the Gemini Observatory, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under a cooperative agreement with the NSF on behalf of the Gemini partnership: The United States, The United Kingdom, Canada, Chile, Australia, Brazil, and Argentina, with supporting data collected at the Subaru Telescope, operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan; the 2.5 m Nordic Optical Telescope, operated on the island of La Palma jointly by Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, in the Spanish Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos of the Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias; the 3.5 m Wisconsin-Indian-Yale-NOAO Telescope, at the WIYN Observatory which is a joint facility of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Indiana University, Yale University, and the National Optical Astronomy Observatory; and the Apache Point Observatory 3.5 m telescope, which is owned and operated by the Astrophysical Research Consortium.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present observations of two strongly lensed z ~ 5 Lyman-alpha emitting galaxies that were discovered in the Sloan Giant Arcs Survey (SGAS). We identify the two sources as SGAS J091541+382655 at z = 5.200 and SGAS J134331+415455 at z = 4.994. We measure their AB magnitudes at (i, z) = (23.34 Â± 0.09, 23.29 Â± 0.13) mag and (i, z) = (23.78 Â± 0.18, 24.24^+0.18 _-0.16) mag and the rest-frame equivalent widths of the Lyman-alpha emission at 25.3 Â± 4.1 AA and 135.6 Â± 20.3 AA for SGAS J091541+382655 and SGAS J134331+415455, respectively. Each source is strongly lensed by a massive galaxy cluster in the foreground, and the magnifications due to gravitational lensing are recovered from strong lens modeling of the foreground lensing potentials. We use the magnification to calculate the intrinsic, unlensed Lyman-alpha and UV continuum luminosities for both sources, as well as the implied star formation rates. We find SGAS J091541+382655 and SGAS J134341+415455 to be galaxies with (L _ Ly-alpha, L _UV) &amp;lt;= (0.6 L*_ Ly-alpha, 2 L*_UV) and (L _ Ly-alpha, L _UV) = (0.5 L*_ Ly-alpha, 0.9 L*_UV), respectively. Comparison of the spectral energy distributions of both sources against stellar population models produces estimates of the mass in young stars in each galaxy; we report an upper limit of M _stars &amp;lt;= 7.9^+3.7 _-2.5 	imes 10^7 M _sun h ^-1 _0.7 for SGAS J091531+382655 and a range of viable masses for SGAS J134331+415455 of 2 	imes 10^8 M _sun h ^-1 _0.7&amp;lt; M _stars &amp;lt; 6 	imes 10^9 M _sun h ^-1 _0.7.

        <abstract>We present discovery images, together with follow-up imaging and spectroscopy, of two large-separation gravitational lenses found by our survey for wide arcs [the CAmbridge Sloan Survey Of Wide ARcs in the skY (CASSOWARY)]. The survey exploits the multicolour photometry of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to find multiple blue components around red galaxies. CASSOWARY 2 (or 'the Cheshire Cat') is composed of two massive early-type galaxies at z = 0.426 and 0.432, respectively, lensing two background sources, the first a star-forming galaxy at z = 0.97 and the second a high -redshift galaxy (z \&amp;gt; 1.4). There are at least three images of the former source and probably four or more of the latter, arranged in two giant arcs. The mass enclosed within the larger arc of radius \~11 arcsec is \~33 \\times 10^12M_solar. CASSOWARY 3 comprises an arc of three bright images of a z = 0.725 source, lensed by a foreground elliptical at z = 0.274. The radius of the arc is \~4 arcsec and the enclosed mass is \~2.5 \\times 10^12M_solar. Together with earlier discoveries like the Cosmic Horseshoe and the 8 o'clock Arc, these new systems, with separations intermediate between the arcsecond-separation lenses of typical strong galaxy lensing and arcminute-separation cluster lenses, probe the very high end of the galaxy mass function.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report the discovery of an almost complete ~300 degree Einstein ring of diameter 10 arcsec in Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 5 (DR5). Spectroscopic data from the 6 m telescope of the Special Astrophysical Observatory reveal that the deflecting galaxy has a line-of-sight velocity dispersion in excess of 400 km/s and a redshift of 0.444, while the source is a star-forming galaxy with a redshift of 2.379. From its color, luminosity, and velocity dispersion, we argue that this is the most massive galaxy lens hitherto discovered.</abstract>

        <abstract>Measurement of the time delay between multiple images of a gravitational lens system is potentially an accurate method of determining the Hubble constant over cosmological distances. One of the most promising candidates for an application of this technique is the system B0218+357, which was found in the Jodrell Bank/VLA Astrometric Survey (JVAS). This system consists of two images of a compact radio source, separated by 335 milliarcsec, and an Einstein ring which can provide a strong constraint on the mass distribution in the lens. We present here the results of a three-month VLA monitoring campaign at two frequencies. The data are of high quality, and both images show clear variations in total flux density, percentage polarization and polarization position angle at both frequencies. The time delay between the variations in the two images has been calculated using a chi-squared minimization to be 10.5 Â± 0.4 d at 95 per cent confidence, with the error being derived from Monte Carlo simulations of the light curves. Although mass modelling of the system is at a preliminary stage, taking the lensing galaxy to be a singular isothermal ellipsoid and using the new value for the time delay, we obtain a value for the Hubble constant of 69^+13\_-19 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, again at 95 per cent confidence.</abstract>

        <abstract>Gravitational lenses offer the possibility of accurately determining the Hubble parameter (H_0) over cosmological distances, and B0218+357 is one of the most promising systems for an application of this technique. In particular this system has an accurately measured time delay (10.5Â±0.4d) and preliminary mass modelling has given a value for H_0 of 69 -19 +13kms^-1Mpc^-1. The error on this estimate is now dominated by the uncertainty in the mass modelling. As this system contains an Einstein ring it should be possible to constrain the model better by imaging the ring at high resolution. To achieve this we have combined data from MERLIN and the Very Large Array (VLA) at a frequency of 5GHz. In particular MERLIN has been used in multifrequency mode in order to improve substantially the aperture coverage of the combined data set. The resulting map is the best that has been made of the ring and contains many new and interesting features. Efforts are currently underway to exploit the new data for lensing constraints using the LensClean algorithm.</abstract>

        <abstract>Radio monitoring of the gravitational lens system B0218+357 reveals it to be a highly variable source with variations on time-scales of a few days correlated in both images. This shows that the variability is intrinsic to the background lensed source and suggests that similar variations in other intraday variable sources can also be intrinsic in origin.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report the discovery of a new gravitational lens system from the CLASS survey. Radio observations with the VLA, WSRT and MERLIN show that the radio source B0850+054 is composed of two compact components with identical spectra, a separation of 0.7 arcsec and a flux density ratio of 6 : 1. VLBA observations at 5 GHz reveal structures that are consistent with the gravitational lens hypothesis. The brighter of the two images is resolved into a linear string of at least six subcomponents, whilst the weaker image is radially stretched towards the lens galaxy. UKIRT K-band imaging detects an 18.7-mag extended object, but the resolution of the observations is not sufficient to resolve the lensed images and the lens galaxy. Mass modelling has not been possible with the present data and the acquisition of high-resolution optical data is a priority for this system.</abstract>

        <abstract>In this paper we present new observations of the gravitational lens system JVAS B0218+357 made with a global very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) network at a frequency of 8.4 GHz. Our maps have an rms noise of 30 mu Jy beam^-1 and with these we have been able to image much of the extended structure of the radio jet in both the A and B images at high resolution (~1 mas). The main use of these maps will be to enable us to further constrain the lens model for the purposes of H_0 determination. We are able to identify several subcomponents common to both images with the expected parity reversal, including one which we identify as a counter-jet. We have not been successful in detecting either the core of the lensing galaxy or a third image. Using a model of the lensing galaxy we have back-projected both of the images to the source plane and find that they agree well. However, there are small, but significant, differences which we suggest may arise from multi-path scattering in the interstellar medium (ISM) of the lensing galaxy. We also find an exponent of the radial mass distribution of beta~ 1.04, in agreement with lens modelling of published 15-GHz VLBI data. Polarization maps of each image are presented which show that the distributions of polarization across images A and B are different. We suggest that this results from Faraday rotation and associated depolarization in the lensing galaxy.</abstract>

        <abstract>The complex 10-component gravitational lens system B1933+503 has been monitored with the Very Large Array (VLA) during the period 1998 February-June with a view to measuring the time delay between the four compact components and hence to determine the Hubble parameter H_0. Here we present the results of an 'A' configuration 8.4-GHz monitoring campaign that consists of 37 epochs with an average spacing of 2.8d. The data have yielded light curves for the four flat-spectrum radio components (components 1, 3, 4 and 6). We observe only small flux density changes in the four flat-spectrum components that we do not believe are predominantly intrinsic to the source. Therefore the variations do not allow us to determine the independent time delays in this system. However, the data do allow us to accurately determine the flux density ratios between the four flat-spectrum components. These will prove important as modelling constraints and could prove crucial in future monitoring observations should these data show only a monotonic increase or decrease in the flux densities of the flat-spectrum components.</abstract>

        <abstract>Microlensing perturbations to the flux ratios of gravitationally lensed quasar images can vary with wavelength because of the chromatic dependence of the accretion disk's apparent size. Multiwavelength observations of microlensed quasars can thus constrain the temperature profiles of their accretion disks, a fundamental test of an important astrophysical process which is not currently possible using any other method. We present single-epoch broadband flux ratios for 12 quadruply lensed quasars in 8 bands ranging from 0.36 to 2.2 mum, as well as Chandra 0.5-8 keV flux ratios for five of them. We combine the optical/IR and X-ray ratios, together with X-ray ratios from the literature, using a Bayesian approach to constrain the half-light radii of the quasars in each filter. Comparing the overall disk sizes and wavelength slopes to those predicted by the standard thin accretion disk model, we find that on average the disks are larger than predicted by nearly an order of magnitude, with sizes that grow with wavelength with an average slope of ~0.2 rather than the slope of 4/3 predicted by the standard thin disk theory. Though the error bars on the slope are large for individual quasars, the large sample size lends weight to the overall result. Our results present severe difficulties for a standard thin accretion disk as the main source of UV/optical radiation from quasars. This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas, Chile.</abstract>

        <abstract>The Hamburg/ESO quasar HE 1113-0641 is found to be a quadruple gravitational lens, based on observations with the twin 6.5 m Magellan telescopes at the Las Campanas Observatory, and subsequently with the Hubble Space Telescope. The z_S = 1.235 quasar appears in a cross configuration, with i' band magnitudes ranging from 18.0 to 18.8. With a maximum image separation of 0\backslashfarcs\\67, this is the smallest-separation quadruple ever identified using a ground-based optical telescope. Point-spread function (PSF) subtraction reveals a faint lensing galaxy. A simple lens model succeeds in predicting the observed positions of the components, but fails to match their observed flux ratios by up to a magnitude. We estimate the redshift of the lensing galaxy to be z_L ~ 0.7. Time delay estimates are on the order of a day, suggesting that the flux ratio anomalies are not due to variability of the quasar, but may result from substructure or microlensing in the lens galaxy.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report the discovery of a strongly lensed arc system around a field elliptical galaxy in Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) images of a parallel field observed during NICMOS observations of the HST Ultra Deep Field. The ACS parallel data comprise deep imaging in the F435W, F606W, F775W, and F850LP bandpasses. The main arc is at a radius of 1.6'' from the galaxy center and subtends about 120\deg. Spectroscopic follow-up at Magellan Observatory yields a redshift z=0.6174 for the lensing galaxy, and we photometrically estimate z_phot=2.4Â±0.3 for the arc. We also identify a likely counterarc at a radius of 0.6'' that shows structure similar to that seen in the main arc. We model this system and find a good fit to an elliptical isothermal potential of velocity dispersion sigma~300 km s^-1, the value expected from the fundamental plane, and some external shear. Several other galaxies in the field have colors similar to the lensing galaxy and likely make up a small group.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present an analysis of the evolution of the central mass-density profile of massive elliptical galaxies from the SLACS and BELLS strong gravitational lens samples over the redshift interval z \ap 0.1-0.6, based on the combination of strong-lensing aperture mass and stellar velocity-dispersion constraints. We find a significant trend toward steeper mass profiles (parameterized by the power-law density model with rhovpropr ^-gamma) at later cosmic times, with magnitude d &amp;lt; gamma &amp;gt; /dz = -0.60 Â± 0.15. We show that the combined lens-galaxy sample is consistent with a non-evolving distribution of stellar velocity dispersions. Considering possible additional dependence of &amp;lt;gamma &amp;gt; on lens-galaxy stellar mass, effective radius, and S'ersic index, we find marginal evidence for shallower mass profiles at higher masses and larger sizes, but with a significance that is subdominant to the redshift dependence. Using the results of published Monte Carlo simulations of spectroscopic lens surveys, we verify that our mass-profile evolution result cannot be explained by lensing selection biases as a function of redshift. Interpreted as a true evolutionary signal, our result suggests that major dry mergers involving off-axis trajectories play a significant role in the evolution of the average mass-density structure of massive early-type galaxies over the past 6 Gyr. We also consider an alternative non-evolutionary hypothesis based on variations in the strong-lensing measurement aperture with redshift, which would imply the detection of an ''inflection zone'' marking the transition between the baryon-dominated and dark-matter halo-dominated regions of the lens galaxies. Further observations of the combined SLACS+BELLS sample can constrain this picture more precisely, and enable a more detailed investigation of the multivariate dependences of galaxy mass structure across cosmic time.

        <abstract>We present the definitive data for the full sample of 131 strong gravitational lens candidates observed with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) aboard the Hubble Space Telescope by the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) Survey. All targets were selected for higher redshift emission lines and lower redshift continuum in a single Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectrum. The foreground galaxies are primarily of early-type morphology, with redshifts from z\~=0.05 to 0.5 and velocity dispersions from \sigma\~=160 to 400 km s^-1 the faint background emission-line galaxies have redshifts ranging from z\~=0.2 to 1.2. We confirm 70 systems showing clear evidence of multiple imaging of the background galaxy by the foreground galaxy, as well as an additional 19 systems with probable multiple imaging. For 63 clear lensing systems, we present singular isothermal ellipsoid and light-traces-mass gravitational lens models fitted to the ACS imaging data. These strong-lensing mass measurements are supplemented by magnitudes and effective radii measured from ACS surface brightness photometry and redshifts and velocity dispersions measured from SDSS spectroscopy. These data constitute a unique resource for the quantitative study of the interrelations between mass, light, and kinematics in massive early-type galaxies. We show that the SLACS lens sample is statistically consistent with being drawn at random from a parent sample of SDSS galaxies with comparable spectroscopic parameters and effective radii, suggesting that the results of SLACS analyses can be generalized to the massive early-type population. Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by AURA, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.

        <abstract>The Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) Survey is an efficient Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Snapshot imaging survey for new galaxy-scale strong gravitational lenses. The targeted lens candidates are selected spectroscopically from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) database of galaxy spectra for having multiple nebular emission lines at a redshift significantly higher than that of the SDSS target galaxy. The SLACS survey is optimized to detect bright early-type lens galaxies with faint lensed sources in order to increase the sample of known gravitational lenses suitable for detailed lensing, photometric, and dynamical modeling. In this paper, the first in a series on the current results of our HST Cycle 13 imaging survey, we present a catalog of 19 newly discovered gravitational lenses, along with nine other observed candidate systems that are either possible lenses, nonlenses, or nondetections. The survey efficiency is thus \&amp;gt;=68\\%. We also present Gemini 8 m and Magellan 6.5 m integral-field spectroscopic data for nine of the SLACS targets, which further support the lensing interpretation. A new method for the effective subtraction of foreground galaxy images to reveal faint background features is presented. We show that the SLACS lens galaxies have colors and ellipticities typical of the spectroscopic parent sample from which they are drawn (SDSS luminous red galaxies and quiescent MAIN sample galaxies), but are somewhat brighter and more centrally concentrated. Several explanations for the latter bias are suggested. The SLACS survey provides the first statistically significant and homogeneously selected sample of bright early-type lens galaxies, furnishing a powerful probe of the structure of early-type galaxies within the half-light radius. The high confirmation rate of lenses in the SLACS survey suggests consideration of spectroscopic lens discovery as an explicit science goal of future spectroscopic galaxy surveys. Based on data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the 6.5 m Walter Baade (Magellan I) Telescope, the 8 m Gemini North Telescope, and the Hubble Space Telescope.

        <abstract>We present a catalog of 49 spectroscopic strong gravitational lens candidates selected from a Sloan Digital Sky Survey sample of 50,996 luminous red galaxies. Potentially lensed star-forming galaxies are detected through the presence of background oxygen and hydrogen nebular emission lines in the spectra of these massive foreground galaxies. This multiline selection eliminates the ambiguity of single-line identification and provides a very promising sample of candidate galaxy-galaxy lens systems at low to intermediate redshift, with foreground redshifts ranging from 0.16 to 0.49 and background redshifts from 0.25 to 0.81. Any lenses confirmed within our sample would be important new probes of early-type galaxy mass distributions, providing complementary constraints to those obtained from currently known lensed high-redshift quasars. Based in part on observations obtained with the 6.5 m Clay telescope of the Magellan Consortium.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report the discovery of a new Einstein cross at redshift z_source=2.701 based on Lyalpha emission in a cruciform configuration around an SDSS luminous red galaxy (z_lens=0.331). The system was targeted as a possible lens based on an anomalous emission line in the SDSS spectrum. Imaging and spectroscopy from the W. M. Keck Observatory confirm the lensing nature of this system. This is one of the widest-separation galaxy-scale lenses known, with an Einstein radius thetas_E~=1.84''. We present simple gravitational lens models for the system and compute the intrinsic properties of the lensed galaxy. The total mass of the lensing galaxy within the 8.8Â±0.1 kpc enclosed by the lensed images is (5.2Â±0.1)\times10^11 M_solar. The lensed galaxy is a low-mass galaxy (0.2L*) with a high equivalent width Lyalpha line (EW^rest_Lyalpha=46Â±5 \AA). Follow-up studies of this lens system can probe the mass structure of the lensing galaxy and can provide a unique view of an intrinsically faint, high-redshift, star-forming galaxy at high signal-to-noise ratio.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report on a novel search for radio gravitational lenses. Using the Very Large Array, we imaged 10 candidates with both dual redshifts in Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectra and 1.4 GHz radio flux &amp;gt;=2 mJy in the FIRST survey. The VLA maps show that in each case the radio emission is associated with the foreground galaxy rather than being lensed emission from the background galaxy, although at least four of our targets are strong lenses at optical wavelengths. These SDSS dual-redshift systems do not have lensed radio emission at the sensitivity of current radio surveys.</abstract>

        <abstract>The Extragalactic Lens VLBI Imaging Survey (ELVIS) searches for central images of lensed radio quasars, in order to measure the central density profiles of distant galaxies. Here we present sensitive multiepoch Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations of PMN J1838-3427 at 8 GHz, with a 1 sigma noise level of 38 muJy beam^-1. Based on the absence of a central image of the background source at this level, we explore the possibilities for the central matter distribution in the lens galaxy. A power-law density profile, rho~r^-gamma, must have gamma&amp;gt;1.93. Thus, the density profile is close to an isothermal profile (gamma=2) or steeper. The upper limit on any constant-density core in an otherwise isothermal profile is &amp;lt;~5 pc. We also derive the constraints on models in which the density profile is isothermal on kiloparsec scales, but is allowed to have a different power law in the central ~100 pc. If the lens galaxy harbors a supermassive black hole, the galaxy profile is allowed to be shallower, but for the expected black hole mass, the galaxy profile must still be close to isothermal or steeper.</abstract>

        <abstract>We constrain the physical nature of dark matter using the newly identified massive merging galaxy cluster MACS J0025.4-1222. As was previously shown by the example of the Bullet Cluster (1E 0657-56), such systems are ideal laboratories for detecting isolated dark matter and distinguishing between cold dark matter (CDM) and other scenarios (e.g., self-interacting dark matter, alternative gravity theories). MACS J0025.4-1222 consists of two merging subclusters of similar richness at z=0.586. We measure the distribution of X-ray-emitting gas from Chandra X-ray data and find it to be clearly displaced from the distribution of galaxies. A strong (information from highly distorted arcs) and weak (using weakly distorted background galaxies) gravitational lensing analysis based on Hubble Space Telescope observations and Keck arc spectroscopy confirms that the subclusters have near-equal mass. The total mass distribution in each of the subclusters is clearly offset (at &gt;4 sigma significance) from the peak of the hot X-ray-emitting gas (the main baryonic component) but aligned with the distribution of galaxies. We measure the fractions of mass in hot gas (0.09^+0.07_-0.03) and stars (0.010^+0.007_-0.004), consistent with those of typical clusters, finding that dark matter is the dominant contributor to the gravitational field. Under the assumption that the subclusters experienced a head-on collision in the plane of the sky, we obtain an order-of-magnitude estimate of the dark matter self-interaction cross section of sigma/m&lt;4 cm^2 g^-1, reaffirming the results from the Bullet Cluster on the collisionless nature of dark matter. Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555. These observations are associated with programs GO11100 and GO10703. This work is also based on observations collected at the W. M. Keck Observatory.</abstract>

        <abstract>The galaxy cluster 1ES 0657-558 (z=0.296) is remarkably well suited for addressing outstanding issues in both galaxy evolution and fundamental physics. We present a reconstruction of the mass distribution from both strong and weak gravitational lensing data. Multicolor, high-resolution HST ACS images allow detection of many more arc candidates than were previously known, especially around the subcluster. Using the known redshift of one of the multiply imaged systems, we determine the remaining source redshifts using the predictive power of the strong-lens model. Combining this information with shape measurements of "weakly" lensed sources, we derive a high-resolution, absolutely calibrated mass map, using no assumptions regarding the physical properties of the underlying cluster potential. This map provides the best available quantification of the total mass of the central part of the cluster. We also confirm the result from Clowe and colleagues that the total mass does not trace the baryonic mass.

        <abstract>The gravitational potential of clusters of galaxies acts as a cosmic telescope allowing us to find and study galaxies at fainter limits than otherwise possible and thus probe closer to the epoch of formation of the first galaxies. We use the Bullet cluster 1E0657 - 56 (z = 0.296) as a case study, because its high mass and merging configuration makes it one of the most efficient cosmic telescopes we know. We develop a new algorithm to reconstruct the gravitational potential of the Bullet cluster based on a non-uniform adaptive grid, combining strong and weak gravitational lensing data derived from deep Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced Camera for Surveys F606W-F775W-F850LP and ground-based imaging. We exploit this improved mass map to study z ~ 5-6 Lyman break galaxies (LBGs), which we detect as dropouts. One of the LBGs is multiply imaged, providing a geometric confirmation of its high redshift, and is used to further improve our mass model. We quantify the uncertainties in the magnification map reconstruction in the intrinsic source luminosity, and in the volume surveyed, and show that they are negligible compared to sample variance when determining the luminosity function of high-redshift galaxies. With shallower and comparable magnitude limits to Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) and Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS), the Bullet cluster observations, after correcting for magnification, probe deeper into the luminosity function of the high-redshift galaxies than GOODS and only slightly shallower than HUDF. We conclude that accurately focused cosmic telescopes are the most efficient way to sample the bright end of the luminosity function of high-redshift galaxies andmdashin case they are multiply imagedmdashconfirm their redshifts.

        <abstract>We present gravitational lens models for 20 strong gravitational lens systems observed as part of the Sloan WFC Edge-on Late-type Lens Survey (SWELLS) project. 15 of the lenses are taken from Paper I, while five are newly discovered systems. The systems are galaxy-galaxy lenses where the foreground deflector has an inclined disc, with a wide range of morphological types, from late-type spiral to lenticular. For each system, we compare the total mass inside the critical curve inferred from gravitational lens modelling to the stellar mass inferred from stellar population synthesis (SPS) models, computing the stellar mass fraction f*\equivM_SPS/M_lens. We find that, for the lower mass SWELLS systems, adoption of a Salpeter stellar initial mass function (IMF) leads to estimates of f* that exceed 1. This is unphysical and provides strong evidence against the Salpeter IMF being valid for these systems. Taking the lower mass end of the SWELLS sample (sigma_SIE &amp;lt; 230 km s^-1), we find that the IMF is lighter (in terms of stellar mass-to-light ratio) than Salpeter with 98 per cent probability, and consistent with the Chabrier IMF and IMFs between the two. This result is consistent with previous studies of spiral galaxies based on independent techniques. In combination with recent studies of massive early-type galaxies that have favoured a heavier Salpeter-like IMF, this result strengthens the evidence against a universal stellar IMF.</abstract>

        <abstract>In a previous paper, we outlined a new Bayesian method for inferring the properties of extended gravitational lenses given data in the form of resolved images. This method holds the most promise for optimally extracting information from the observed image, while providing reliable uncertainties in all parameters. Here, we apply the method to the well studied optical Einstein ring 0047-2808. Our results are in broad agreement with previous studies, showing that the density profile of the lensing galaxy is aligned within a few degrees of the light profile, and suggesting that the source galaxy (at redshift 3.6) is a binary system, although its size is only of order 1-2 kpc. We also find that the mass of the elliptical lensing galaxy enclosed by the image is (2.91Â±0.01)x10^11 M_solar. Our method is able to achieve improved resolution for the source reconstructions, although we also find that some of the uncertainties are greater than has been found in previous analyses, due to the inclusion of extra pixels and a more general lens model.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present the first high-resolution images of CSWA 31, a gravitational lens system observed as part of the Sloan Lenses Unravelled by Gemini Studies programme. These systems exhibit complex image structure with the potential to strongly constrain the mass distribution of the massive lens galaxies, as well as the complex morphology of the sources. In this paper, we describe the strategy used to reconstruct the unlensed source profile and the lens galaxy mass profiles. We introduce a prior distribution over multiwavelength sources that is realistic as a representation of our knowledge about the surface brightness profiles of galaxies and groups of galaxies. To carry out the inference computationally, we use diffusive nested sampling, an efficient variant of nested sampling that uses Markov Chain Monte Carlo to sample the complex posterior distributions and compute the normalizing constant. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach with the reconstruction of the group-group gravitational lens system CSWA 31, finding the source to be composed of five merging spiral galaxies magnified by a factor of 13.</abstract>

        <abstract>We analyze deep multicolor Advanced Camera images of the largest known gravitational lens, A1689. Radial and tangential arcs delineate the critical curves in unprecedented detail, and many small counterimages are found near the center of mass. We construct a flexible light deflection field to predict the appearance and positions of counterimages. The model is refined as new counterimages are identified and incorporated to improve the model, yielding a total of 106 images of 30 multiply lensed background galaxies, spanning a wide redshift range, 1.0\&amp;lt;z\&amp;lt;5.5. The resulting mass map is more circular in projection than the clumpy distribution of cluster galaxies, and the light is more concentrated than the mass within r\&amp;lt;50 kpc h^-1. The projected mass profile flattens steadily toward the center with a shallow mean slope of dlog\Sigma/dlogr\~=-0.55Â±0.1, over the observed range r\&amp;lt;250 kpc h^-1, matching well an NFW profile, but with a relatively high concentration, C_vir=8.2^+2.1_-1.8. A softened isothermal profile (r_core=20Â±2'') is not conclusively excluded, illustrating that lensing constrains only projected quantities. Regarding cosmology, we clearly detect the purely geometric increase of bend angles with redshift. The dependence on the cosmological parameters is weak owing to the proximity of A1689, z=0.18, constraining the locus, \Omega_M+\Omega_Lambda\&amp;lt;=1.2. This consistency with standard cosmology provides independent support for our model, because the redshift information is not required to derive an accurate mass map. Similarly, the relative fluxes of the multiple images are reproduced well by our best-fitting lens model.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report 31 GHz CARMA observations of IDCS J1426.5+3508, an infrared-selected galaxy cluster at z = 1.75. A Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) decrement is detected toward this cluster, indicating a total mass of M _ 200, m = (4.3 Â± 1.1) \times 10^14 M _â in agreement with the approximate X-ray mass of ~5 \times 10^14 M _â. IDCS J1426.5+3508 is by far the most distant cluster yet detected via the SZ effect, and the most massive z &gt;= 1.4 galaxy cluster found to date. Despite the mere ~1\% probability of finding it in the 8.82 deg^2 IRAC Distant Cluster Survey, IDCS J1426.5+3508 is not completely unexpected in LambdaCDM once the area of large, existing surveys is considered. IDCS J1426.5+3508 is, however, among the rarest, most extreme clusters ever discovered and indeed is an evolutionary precursor to the most massive known clusters at all redshifts. We discuss how imminent, highly sensitive SZ experiments will complement infrared techniques for statistical studies of the formation of the most massive galaxy clusters in the z &gt; 1.5 universe, including potential precursors to IDCS J1426.5+3508.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present a catalog of 25 definite and 11 probable strong galaxy-galaxy gravitational lens systems with lens redshifts 0.4 &lt;~ z &lt;~ 0.7, discovered spectroscopically by the presence of higher-redshift emission lines within the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) of luminous galaxies, and confirmed with high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images of 44 candidates. Our survey extends the methodology of the Sloan Lens Advanced Camera for Surveys survey (SLACS) to higher redshift. We describe the details of the BOSS spectroscopic candidate detections, our HST ACS image processing and analysis methods, and our strong gravitational lens modeling procedure. We report BOSS spectroscopic parameters and ACS photometric parameters for all candidates, and mass-distribution parameters for the best-fit singular isothermal ellipsoid models of definite lenses. Our sample to date was selected using only the first six months of BOSS survey-quality spectroscopic data. The full five-year BOSS database should produce a sample of several hundred strong galaxy-galaxy lenses and in combination with SLACS lenses at lower redshift, strongly constrain the redshift evolution of the structure of elliptical, bulge-dominated galaxies as a function of luminosity, stellar mass, and rest-frame color, thereby providing a powerful test for competing theories of galaxy formation and evolution. Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555. These observations are associated with program 12209. Based on spectroscopic data from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present optical V and i-band light curves of the gravitationally lensed BAL quasar HE 2149-2745. The data, obtained with the 1.5 m Danish Telescope (ESO-La Silla) between October 1998 and December 2000, are the first from a long-term project aimed at monitoring selected lensed quasars in the Southern Hemisphere. A time delay of 103Â±12 days is determined from the light curves. In addition, VLT/FORS1 spectra of HE 2149-2745 are deconvolved in order to obtain the spectrum of the faint lensing galaxy, free of any contamination by the bright nearby two quasar images. By cross-correlating the spectrum with galaxy-templates we obtain a tentative redshift estimate of z=0.495Â±0.01. Adopting this redshift, a Omega =0.3, Lambda =0.7 cosmology, and a chosen analytical lens model, our time-delay measurement yields a Hubble constant of H_0=66 Â± 8 km s^-1 Mpc^-1 (1sigma error) with an estimated systematic error of Â±3 km s^-1 Mpc^-1. Using non-parametric models yields H_0=65 Â± 8 km s^-1 Mpc^-1 (1sigma error) and confirms that the lens exhibits a very dense/concentrated mass profile. Finally, we note, as in other cases, that the flux ratio between the two quasar components is wavelength dependent. While the flux ratio in the broad emission lines - equal to 3.7 - remains constant with wavelength, the continuum of the brighter component is bluer. Although the data do not rule out extinction of one quasar image relative to the other as a possible explanation, the effect could also be produced by differential microlensing by stars in the lensing galaxy. Based on observations made with the Danish 1.5-m telescope (ESO, La Silla, Chile) and at VLT UT1 Antu (ESO-Paranal, Chile) (Proposals: 64.O-0205(B), 65.O-0214(B), 66.A-0203(B), 67.A-0115(B), 66.B-0139(A) and HST archives ID 8175).</abstract>

        <abstract>We present optical R-band light curves of the gravitationally lensed quasar &lt;ASTROBJ&gt;SBS 1520+530&lt;/ASTROBJ&gt; derived from data obtained at the Nordic Optical Telescope. A time delay of 130Â±3 days (1sigma ) is determined from the light curves. In addition, spectra of &lt;ASTROBJ&gt;SBS 1520+530&lt;/ASTROBJ&gt; obtained at the Keck Observatory are spatially deconvolved in order to extract the spectrum of the faint lensing galaxy, free of any contamination by the light from the bright quasar images. This spectrum indicates a lens redshift z=0.717, in agreement with one of the absorption systems found in the quasar spectra. The best mass model of the system includes a second nearby galaxy and a cluster of galaxies in addition to the main lensing galaxy. Adopting this model and an Omega =0.3, Lambda =0.7 cosmology, our time-delay measurement yields a Hubble constant of H_0=51 Â± 9 km s^-1 Mpc^-1 (1sigma error). Based on observations made with the Nordic Optical, operated on the island of La Palma jointly by Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden, in the Spanish Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos of the Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias and the W.

        <abstract>Aims:We present data from the CFHTLS Strong Lensing Legacy Survey (SL2S). Due to the unsurpassed combined depth, area and image quality of the Canada-France-Hawaii Legacy Survey it is becoming possible to uncover a large, statistically well-defined sample of strong gravitational lenses which spans the dark halo mass spectrum predicted by the concordance model from galaxy to cluster haloes. &lt;BR /&gt;Methods: We describe the development of several automated procedures to find strong lenses of various mass regimes in CFHTLS images. &lt;BR /&gt;Results: The preliminary sample of about 40 strong lensing candidates discovered in the CFHTLS T0002 release, covering an effective field of view of 28 deg^2 is presented. These strong lensing systems were discovered using an automated search and consist mainly of gravitational arc systems with splitting angles between 2 and 15 arcsec. This sample shows for the first time that it is possible to uncover a large population of strong lenses from galaxy groups with typical halo masses of about 10^13~h^-1~M_sun. We discuss the future evolution of the SL2S project and its main scientific aims for the next 3 years, in particular our observational strategy to extract the hundreds of gravitational rings also present in these fields.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report the discovery of a partial Einstein ring of radius 1.48 arcsec produced by a massive (and seemingly isolated) elliptical galaxy. The spectroscopic follow-up at the VLT reveals a 2L_star galaxy at z=0.986, which is lensing a post-starburst galaxy at z=3.773. This unique configuration yields a very precise measure of the mass of the lens within the Einstein radius, (8.3 Â± 0.4) 	imes 10^11h_70^-1M_â . The fundamental plane relation indicates an evolution rate of dlog (M/L)_B / dz = -0.57Â±0.04, similar to other massive ellipticals at this redshift. The source galaxy shows strong interstellar absorption lines indicative of large gas-phase metallicities, with fading stellar populations after a burst. Higher resolution spectra and imaging will allow the detailed study of an unbiased representative of the galaxy population when the universe was just 12\% of its current age.</abstract>

        <abstract>We recently reported the discovery of FORJ0332&amp;#8722;3557, a lensed Lyman-break galaxy at z = 3.77 in a remarkable example of strong galaxyâgalaxy gravitational lensing. We present here a medium-resolution rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) spectrum of the source, which appears to be similar to the well-known Lyman-break galaxy MS1512&amp;#8722;cB58 at z = 2.73. The spectral energy distribution is consistent with a stellar population of less than 30 Ma, with an extinction of A = 0.5 mag and an extinction-corrected star formation rate SFR of 200â300 h&amp;#8722;1 M a&amp;#8722;1 . v UV 70&amp;#8857; The Lyalpha line exhibits a damped profile in absorption produced by a column density of about NHI = (2.5 Â± 1.0) Ã 1021 cm&amp;#8722;2, superimposed on an emission line shifted both spatially (0.5 arcsec with respect to the UV continuum source) and in velocity space (+830 km s&amp;#8722;1 with respect to the low-ionization absorption lines from its interstellar medium), a clear signature of outflows with an expansion velocity of about 270 km s&amp;#8722;1 . A strong emission line from He II lambda164.04 nm indicates the presence of WolfâRayet stars and reinforces the interpretation of a very young starburst. The metallic lines indicate subsolar abundances of elements Si, Al and C in the ionized gas phase.</abstract>

        <abstract>Scaling relations among dark matter (DM) and stellar quantities are a valuable tool to constrain formation scenarios and the evolution of galactic structures. However, most of the DM properties are actually not directly measured, but derived through model-dependent mass-mapping procedures. It is therefore crucial to adopt theoretically and observationally well founded models. We use here an updated version of the secondary infall model (SIM) to predict the halo density profile, taking into account the effects of angular momentum, dissipative friction and baryons collapse. The resulting family of halo profiles depends only on one parameter, the virial mass, and nicely fits the projected mass and aperture velocity dispersion of a sample of intermediate redshift lens galaxies. We derive DM-related quantities (namely the column density and the Newtonian acceleration) and investigate their correlations with stellar mass, luminosity, effective radius and virial mass.</abstract>

        <abstract>We detect neutral hydrogen 21 cm absorption toward the 'smallest Einstein ring', 0218 + 357, at a redshift of 0.6847. The implied H I column density is N(H I) = 4 x 10 exp 18(Ts/f) cm exp -2, where Ts is the spin temperature of the gas and f is the H I covering factor. The FWHM of the line based on a Gaussian fit is 43 km/s, and the full width to the first null is about 75 km/s. This observation demonstrates a new, potentially powerful method with which to determine lens redshifts in otherwise difficult circumstances. It also allows for the possibility of 'mapping' the gravitational potential of the lens in a way independent of lens models.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present the CXOCY J220132.8-320144 system, which is composed of an edge-on spiral galaxy at z=0.32 lensing a z=3.9 background quasar. Two images of the quasar are seen. The geometry of the system is favorable to separate the relative mass contribution of the disk and halo in the inner parts of the galaxy. We model the system with one elliptical mass component with the same ellipticity as the light distribution and manage to reproduce the quasar image positions and fluxes. We also model the system with two mass components, disk and halo. Again, we manage to reproduce the quasar image positions and fluxes. However, all models predict at least a third visible image close to the disk that is not seen in our images. We speculate that this is most likely due to extinction by the disk. We also measure the rotational velocity of the galaxy at 2.7 disk scale radius to be v_c=130Â±20 km s^-1 from the [O II] emission lines. When adding the rotational velocity constraint to the models, we find that the contribution to the rotational velocity of the disk is likely to be equal to or larger than the contribution of the halo at this radius. The detection of the third image and a more accurate measurement of the rotational velocity would help to set tighter constraints on the mass distribution of this edge-on spiral galaxy. Partly based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, Chile, under programs 72.A-509 and 74.A-0493. This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5 meter Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.</abstract>

        <abstract>&lt;BR /&gt; Aims: We attempt to place very accurate positional constraints on seven gravitationally lensed quasars currently being monitored by the COSMOGRAIL collaboration, and shape parameters for the light distribution of the lensing galaxy. We attempt to determine simple mass models that reproduce the observed configuration and predict time delays. We finally test, for the quads, whether there is evidence of astrometric perturbations produced by substructures in the lensing galaxy, which may preclude a good fit with the simple models. &lt;BR /&gt; Methods: We apply the iterative MCS deconvolution method to near-IR HST archival data of seven gravitationally lensed quasars. This deconvolution method allows us to differentiate the contributions of the point sources from those of extended structures such as Einstein rings. This method leads to an accuracy of 1-2 mas in the relative positions of the sources and lens. The limiting factor of the method is the uncertainty in the instrumental geometric distortions. We then compute mass models of the lensing galaxy using state-of-the-art modeling techniques. &lt;BR /&gt; Results: We determine the relative positions of the lensed images and lens shape parameters of seven lensed quasars: HE 0047-1756, RX J1131-1231, SDSS J1138+0314, SDSS J1155+6346, SDSS J1226-0006, WFI J2026-4536, and HS 2209+1914. The lensed image positions are derived with 1-2 mas accuracy. Isothermal and de Vaucouleurs mass models are calculated for the whole sample. The effect of the lens environment on the lens mass models is taken into account with a shear term. Doubly imaged quasars are equally well fitted by each of these models. A large amount of shear is necessary to reproduce SDSS J1155+6346 and SDSS J1226-006. In the latter case, we identify a nearby galaxy as the dominant source of shear. The quadruply imaged quasar SDSS J1138+0314 is reproduced well by simple lens models, which is not the case for the two other quads, RX J1131-1231 and WFI J2026-4536. This might be the signature of astrometric perturbations caused by massive substructures in the galaxy, which are unaccounted for by the models. Other possible explanations are also presented. Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA HST Hubble Space Telescope, obtained from the data archive at the Space Science Institute, which is operated by AURA, the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS-5-26555.</abstract>

Two components with apparent V magnitudes 18.2mag and 18.7mag are resolved with a distance separation 1.6''. The spectra, taken with the long-slit spectrograph, exhibit strong SiIV/OIV], CIV and CIII] emission lines with the redshifts 1.855Â±0.002 and 1.854Â±0.002, respectively, and two systems of metal-line absorption at z\_abs\_=0.7155Â±0.0009 and 0.8147Â±0.0009. The blue wing of CIV lines displays BAL futures. SBS 1520+530, the second gravitationally lensed BAL QSO, offers good opportunity for ground-based and space studies of numerous phenomena connected with physics of lensing because of its apparent magnitude and appropriate separation between companions.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present Chandra monitoring data for six gravitationally lensed quasars: QJ 0158-4325, HE 0435-1223, SDSS 0924+0219, SDSS 1004+4112, HE 1104-1805, and Q 2237+0305. X-ray microlensing variability is detected in all six lenses with high confidence. We furthermore detect energy-dependent microlensing in HE 0435-1223, SDSS 0924+0219, SDSS 1004+4112, and Q 2237+0305. Through a detailed spectral analysis for each lens we find that simple power-law models plus Gaussian emission lines give good fits to the spectra. We detect intrinsic spectral variability in two epochs of Q 2237+0305, and differential absorption between images in QJ 0158-4325 and Q2237+0305. We also detect the Fe Kalpha emission line in all six lenses, and the Ni XXVII Kalpha line in two images of Q 2237+0305. The rest-frame equivalent widths of the Fe Kalpha lines are measured to be 0.4-1.2 keV, significantly higher than those measured in typical active galactic nuclei of similar X-ray luminosities. This suggests that the Fe Kalpha emission region is more compact or centrally concentrated than the continuum emission region.</abstract>

        <abstract>We confirm an eighth gravitational lens system in the CAmbridge Sloan Survey Of Wide ARcs in the skY (CASSOWARY) catalogue. Exploratory observations with the X-shooter spectrograph on the Very Large Telescope of the European Southern Observatory show the system CASSOWARY 5 (CSWA5) to consist of at least three images of a blue star-forming galaxy at z = 1.0686, lensed by an apparent foreground group of red galaxies, one of which is at z = 0.3877. The lensed galaxy exhibits a rich spectrum with broad interstellar absorption lines and a wealth of nebular emission lines. Preliminary analysis of these features shows the galaxy to be young, with an age of ~25-50Myr. With a star formation rate of ~20M_solaryr^-1, the galaxy has already assembled a stellar mass M_* ~ 3 \times 10^9M_solar and reached half-solar metallicity. Its blue spectral energy distribution and Balmer line ratios suggest negligible internal dust extinction. A more in-depth analysis of the properties of this system is currently hampered by the lack of a viable lensing model. However, it is already clear that CSWA5 shares many of its physical characteristics with the general population of UV-selected galaxies at redshifts z = 1-3, motivating further study of both the source and the foreground mass concentration responsible for the gravitational lensing.

        <abstract>Careful analysis of direct R CCD frames obtained for selected Highly Luminous Quasars in March 1993 with the MPI/ESO 2.2m telescope has revealed that the quasar J03.13 consists of at least two point-like components, constituting therefore a new gravitational lens candidate. Follow-up direct imagery of this interesting object with the New Technology Telescope (NTT) + SUSI in February 1994, using the Bessel B, R and Gunn-i filters, tends to confirm the gravitational lens hypothesis. The mean angular separation and magnitude difference between the A \amp B images are found to be 0.84''Â±0.03'' and 2.1Â±0.1mag, respectively. A spatially unresolved, medium resolution spectrum of J03.13, obtained with the NTT + EMMI in February 1994, shows that the QSO has a redshift z=2.55, with Lyalpha and CIV absorptions at z=2.34 and MgII, MgI and FeII absorptions at z=1.085. The latter absorptions might be associated with a sigma=206km/s lens galaxy. B, R and Gunn-i photometric observations of J03.13 during 1994 and 1995 do not show evidence for flux variations exceeding 0.03mag. HST direct imagery with WFPC2 and FOS spectroscopy of J03.13 A \amp B are planned during cycle 5.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present X-ray and weak lensing observations of the merging cluster system 1E0657 556. Due to the recently collision of a merging subcluster with the main cluster, the X-ray plasma has been displaced from the cluster galaxies in both components. The weak lensing data shows that the lensing surface potential is in spatial agreement with the galaxies (~10% of the observed baryons) and not with the X-ray plasma (~90% of the observed baryons). We argue that this shows that regardless of the form of the gravitational force law at these large distances and low accelerations, these observations require that the majority of the mass of the system be some form of unseen matter.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present a strong lensing (SL) mass model of A1689 which resolves substructures an estimated 25 kpc across within the central ~400 kpc diameter. We achieve this resolution by perfectly reproducing the observed (strongly lensed) input positions of 168 multiple images of 55 knots residing within 135 images of 42 galaxies. Our model makes no assumptions about light tracing mass, yet we reproduce the brightest visible structures with some slight deviations. A1689 remains one of the strongest known lenses on the sky, with an Einstein radius of R_E = 47farcs0 Â± 1farcs2 (143^+3 _-4 kpc) for a lensed source at z_s = 2. We find that a single Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) or S'ersic profile yields a good fit simultaneously (with only slight tension) to both our SL mass model and published weak lensing (WL) measurements at larger radius (out to the virial radius). According to this NFW fit, A1689 has a mass of M _vir = 2.0^+0.5 _-0.3 	imes 10^15 M _sun h ^-1 _70 (M _200 = 1.8^+0.4 _-0.3 	imes 10^15 M _sun h ^-1 _70) within the virial radius r _vir = 3.0 Â± 0.2 Mpc h ^-1 _70 (r _200 = 2.4^+0.1 _-0.2 Mpc h ^-1 _70), and a central concentration c _vir = 11.5^+1.5 _-1.4 (c _200 = 9.2 Â± 1.2). Our SL model prefers slightly higher concentrations than previous SL models, bringing our SL + WL constraints in line with other recent derivations. Our results support those of previous studies which find A1689 has either an anomalously large concentration or significant extra mass along the line of sight (perhaps in part due to triaxiality). If clusters are generally found to have higher concentrations than realized in simulations, this could indicate that they formed earlier, perhaps as a result of early dark energy.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present a new approach to gravitational lens mass map reconstruction. Our mass map solutions perfectly reproduce the positions, fluxes, and shears of all multiple images, and each mass map accurately recovers the underlying mass distribution to a resolution limited by the number of multiple images detected. We demonstrate our technique given a mock galaxy cluster similar to Abell 1689, which gravitationally lenses 19 mock background galaxies to produce 93 multiple images. We also explore cases in which as few as four multiple images are observed. Mass map solutions are never unique, and our method makes it possible to explore an extremely flexible range of physical (and unphysical) solutions, all of which perfectly reproduce the data given. Each reconfiguration of the source galaxies produces a new mass map solution. An optimization routine is provided to find those source positions (and redshifts, within uncertainties) that produce the ''most physical" mass map solution, according to a new figure of merit developed here. Our method imposes no assumptions about the slope of the radial profile or mass following light. However, unlike ''nonparametric" grid-based methods, the number of free parameters that we solve for is only as many as the number of observable constraints (or slightly greater if fluxes are constrained). For each set of source positions and redshifts, mass map solutions are obtained ''instantly" via direct matrix inversion by smoothly interpolating the deflection field using a recently developed mathematical technique. Our LensPerfect software is straightforward and easy to use, and is publicly available on our Web site.</abstract>

        <abstract>We precisely constrain the inner mass profile of A2261 (z = 0.225) for the first time and determine that this cluster is not overconcentrated as found previously, implying a formation time in agreement with LambdaCDM expectations. These results are based on multiple strong-lensing analyses of new 16-band Hubble Space Telescope imaging obtained as part of the Cluster Lensing and Supernova survey with Hubble. Combining this with revised weak-lensing analyses of Subaru wide-field imaging with five-band Subaru + KPNO photometry, we place tight new constraints on the halo virial mass M _vir = (2.2 Â± 0.2) \times 10^15 M _&amp;#9737; h ^--1 _70 (within r _vir \ap 3 Mpc h ^--1 _70) and concentration c _vir = 6.2 Â± 0.3 when assuming a spherical halo. This agrees broadly with average c(M, z) predictions from recent LambdaCDM simulations, which span 5 &amp;lt;~ langcrang &amp;lt;~ 8. Our most significant systematic uncertainty is halo elongation along the line of sight (LOS). To estimate this, we also derive a mass profile based on archival Chandra X-ray observations and find it to be ~35\% lower than our lensing-derived profile at r _2500 ~ 600 kpc. Agreement can be achieved by a halo elongated with a ~2:1 axis ratio along our LOS. For this elongated halo model, we find M _vir = (1.7 Â± 0.2) \times 10^15 M _&amp;#9737; h ^--1 _70 and c _vir = 4.6 Â± 0.2, placing rough lower limits on these values. The need for halo elongation can be partially obviated by non-thermal pressure support and, perhaps entirely, by systematic errors in the X-ray mass measurements. We estimate the effect of background structures based on MMT/Hectospec spectroscopic redshifts and find that these tend to lower M _vir further by ~7\% and increase c _vir by ~5\%.</abstract>

        <abstract>High-precision VLA flux density measurements for the lensed images of 0218+357 yield a time delay of 10.1^+1.5_-1.6 days (95% confidence). This is consistent with independent measurements carried out at the same epoch by Biggs and colleagues in 1999, lending confidence to the robustness of the time delay measurement. However, since both measurements make use of the same features in the light curves, it is possible that the effects of unmodeled processes, such as scintillation or microlensing, are biasing both time delay measurements in the same way. Our time delay estimates result in confidence intervals that are somewhat larger than those of Biggs et al., probably because we adopt a more general model of the source variability, allowing for constant and variable components. When considered in relation to the lens mass model of Biggs et al., our best-fit time delay implies a Hubble constant of H_0=71^+17_-23 km s^-1 Mpc^-1 for Omega_0=1 and lambda_0=0 (95% confidence; filled beam). This confidence interval for H_0 does not reflect systematic error, which may be substantial, as a result of uncertainty in the position of the lens galaxy. We also measure the flux ratio of the variable components of 0218+357, a measurement of a small region that should more closely represent the true lens magnification ratio. We find ratios of 3.2^+0.3_-0.4 (95% confidence; 8 GHz) and 4.3^+0.5_-0.8 (15 GHz). Unlike the reported flux ratios on scales of 0.1", these ratios are not significantly different. We investigate the significance of apparent differences in the variability properties of the two images of the background active galactic nucleus. We conclude that the differences are not significant and that time series much longer than our 100 day time series will be required to investigate propagation effects in this way.</abstract>

        <abstract>We consider a wide range of parametric mass models for B1933+503, a 10-image radio lens, and identify shared properties of the models with the best fits. The approximate rotation curves vary by less than 8.5% from the average value between the innermost and the outermost image (1.5-4.1 h^-1 kpc) for models within 1 sigma of the best fit, and the radial dependence of the shear strength and angle also have common behavior for the best models. The time delay between images 1 and 6, the longest delay between the radio cores, is Deltat=10.6^+2.4_-1.1 h^-1 days (Omega_0=0.3, lambda_0=0.7), including all the modeling uncertainties. Deeper infrared observations, to more precisely register the lens galaxy with the radio images and to measure the properties of the Einstein ring image of the radio source's host galaxy, would significantly improve the model constraints and further reduce the uncertainties in the mass distribution and time delay.</abstract>

        <abstract>A unique reconstruction of the image of a high-redshift source galaxy responsible for multiple long arcs in the z = 0.4 cluster 0024+1654 is obtained by inverse lensing. Deep B- and I-band imaging with the Hubble Space Telescope enables high resolution of the arcs due to strong gravitational lensing of the background source. The gravitational lens in the foreground cluster is thus used to obtain a magnified view of the distant source. Four strongly lensed images of the source lead to a unique reconstruction. Each of the long arcs, when unlensed, leads to the same reconstructed source image, exhibiting a beaded, ringlike morphology. The U luminosity of the ring alone is equivalent to that of a normal galaxy. This is likely a galaxy in formation.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report the detection of the H2O molecule in absorption at a redshift, z, of 0.68466 in front of the gravitationally lensed quasar B0218+357. We detect the fundamental transition of ortho-water at 556.93 GHz (redshifted to 330.59 GHz). The line is highly optically thick and relatively wide (15 km s-1 FWHM), with a profile that is similar to that of the previously detected CO(2--1) and HCO+(2--1) optically thick absorption lines toward this quasar. From the measured level of the continuum at 330.59 GHz, which corresponds to the level expected from the power-law spectrum S( nu ) ~ nu -0.25 already observed at lower frequencies, we deduce that the filling factor of the H2O absorption is large. It was already known from the high optical thickness of the CO, 13CO, and C18O lines that molecular clouds entirely cover one of the two lensed images of the quasar (all its continuum is absorbed); our present results indicate that H2O clouds are covering a comparable surface. The H2O molecules are therefore not confined to small cores with a tiny filling factor but are extended over parsec scales. The H2O line has a very large optical depth, and only isotopic lines could give us the water abundance. We have also searched for the 183 GHz line in absorption, obtaining only an upper limit; this yields constraints on the excitation temperature.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present results from a search for gravitationally lensed galaxies present in the Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/Wide Field Camera-3 (WFC3) images of the Cosmic Assembly Near-IR Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS). We present one bona fide lens system in UDS and two compact lens candidates in the GOODS-S field. The lensing system in UDS involves two background galaxies, one at z=1.847 lensed to an arc and a counterimage, and the second at a photometric redshift of z=2.32^+0.10_-0.06 lensed to a double image. We reconstruct the lensed sources in the source plane and find in each of the two cases the sources can be separated to a pair of galaxies. The sources responsible for the arc are compact with effective radii of 0.3 to 0.4 kpc in WFC3 J_125-band and a total stellar mass and a star-formation rate of 2.1_-0.4^+2.4 times 10^7 M_sun and 2.3_-1.7^+ 0.6 M_sun yr^-1, respectively.The abnormally high H_160-band flux of this source is likely due to OIII emission lines with a rest-frame equivalent width about 700 Angstroms for OIII 5007 Angstroms. The sources responsible for the double image have corresponding values of about 0.4 to 0.5 kpc, 1.4_-0.8^+1.9 times 10^9 M_sun, and 8.7_-7.0^+11.1 M_sun yr^-1. Once completed CANDELS is expected to contain about 15 lensing systems and will allow statistical studies on both lensing mass profiles and z ~ 2 lensed galaxies.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present accurate time delays for the quadruply imaged quasar HE 0435-1223. The delays were measured from 575 independent photometric points obtained in the R-band between January 2004 and March 2010. With seven years of data, we clearly show that quasar image A is affected by strong microlensing variations and that the time delays are best expressed relative to quasar image B. We measured Deltat_BC = 7.8 Â± 0.8 days, Deltat_BD = -6.5 Â± 0.7 days and Deltat_CD = -14.3 Â± 0.8 days. We spacially deconvolved HST NICMOS2 F160W images to derive accurate astrometry of the quasar images and to infer the light profile of the lensing galaxy. We combined these images with a stellar population fitting of a deep VLT spectrum of the lensing galaxy to estimate the baryonic fraction, f_b, in the Einstein radius. We measured f_b = 0.65_-0.10^+0.13 if the lensing galaxy has a Salpeter IMF and f_b = 0.45_-0.07^+0.04 if it has a Kroupa IMF. The spectrum also allowed us to estimate the velocity dispersion of the lensing galaxy, sigma_ap = 222 Â± 34 km s^-1. We used f_b and sigma_ap to constrain an analytical model of the lensing galaxy composed of an Hernquist plus generalized NFW profile. We solved the Jeans equations numerically for the model and explored the parameter space under the additional requirement that the model must predict the correct astrometry for the quasar images. Given the current error bars on f_b and sigma_ap, we did not constrain H_0 yet with high accuracy, i.e., we found a broad range of models with chi^2 &amp;lt; 1. However, narrowing this range is possible, provided a better velocity dispersion measurement becomes available. In addition, increasing the depth of the current HST imaging data of HE 0435-1223 will allow us to combine ourconstraints with lens reconstruction techniques that make use of the full Einstein ring that is visible in this object. Based on observations made with the 1.2 m Euler Swiss Telescope, the 1.5 m telescope of Maidanak Observatory in Uzbekistan, and with the 1.2 m Mercator Telescope, operated on the island of La Palma by the Flemish Community, at the Spanish Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos of the Instituto de Astrof'\isica de Canarias.

        <abstract>We report the discovery of three new cases of quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) acting as strong gravitational lenses on background emission line galaxies: SDSS J0827+5224 (z_QSO = 0.293, z_s = 0.412), SDSS J0919+2720 (z_QSO = 0.209, z_s = 0.558), SDSS J1005+4016 (z_QSO = 0.230, z_s = 0.441). The selection was carried out using a sample of 22,298 SDSS spectra displaying at least four emission lines at a redshift beyond that of the foreground QSO. The lensing nature is confirmed from Keck imaging and spectroscopy, as well as from HST/WFC3 imaging in the F475W and F814W filters. Two of the QSOs have face-on spiral host galaxies and the third is a QSO+galaxy pair. The velocity dispersion of the host galaxies, inferred from simple lens modeling, is between sigma = 210 and 285 km s^-1, making these host galaxies comparable in mass with the SLACS sample of early-type strong lenses. Based on data obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation. Also based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555. These observations are associated with program \#GO12233.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report on deep IR imaging of the double quasar HE 1104-1805. A new image deconvolution technique has been applied to the data in order to optimally combine the numerous frames obtained. The resulting J and K' images allow us to detect and study the lensing galaxy between the two lensed QSO images. The near infrared images not only confirm the lensed nature of this double quasar, but also support the previous redshift estimate of z=1.66 for the lensing galaxy. No obvious overdensity of galaxies is detected in the immediate region surrounding the lens, down to limiting magnitudes of J=22 and K=20. The geometry of the system, together with the time delays expected for this lensed quasar, make HE 1104-1805 a remarkable target for future photometric monitoring programs, for the study of microlensing and for the determination of the cosmological parameters in the IR and optical domains.

        <abstract>We analyze a new gravitational lens OAC-GL J1223-1239, serendipitously found in a deep I _814-band image of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). The lens is an L*, edge-on S0 galaxy at z _l = 0.4656. The gravitational arc has a radius of 0farcs42 sime 1.74 h ^-1 kpc. We have determined the total mass and the dark matter (DM) fraction within the Einstein radius R _E as a function of the lensed source redshift, which is presently unknown. For z _s ~ 1.3, which is in the middle of the redshift range plausible for the source according to some external constraints, we find the central velocity dispersion to be ~180 km s^-1. With this value, close to that obtained by means of the Faber-Jackson relation at the lens redshift, we compute a 30\% DM fraction within R _E (given the uncertainty in the source redshift, the allowed range for the DM fraction is 25\%-35\% in our lensing model). When compared with the galaxies in the local universe, the lensing galaxy OAC-GL J1223-1239 seems to fall in the transition regime between massive, DM-dominated galaxies and lower-mass, DM-deficient systems.

        <abstract>Using the IRAM interferometer we have detected J=4-&amp;gt;3 and 5-&amp;gt;4 CO line emission toward the radio quiet quasar PSS 2322+1944. At a redshift of z_CO=4.1199 this is the fourth and strongest detection of CO at z&amp;gt;4. The velocity-integrated CO J=4-&amp;gt;3 and J=5-&amp;gt;4 line fluxes are 4.21 Â± 0.40 and 3.74 Â± 0.56 Jy km s^-1, and the linewidth is ~ 300 km s^-1. The CO J=10-&amp;gt;9 was searched for but not detected with an upper intensity limit of 30 mJy. The 1.35 mm (250 mum rest wavelength) continuum flux density is 7.5Â±1.3 mJy, in agreement with previous bolometer measurements at 1.2 mm with the 30-m IRAM telescope. The 3 mm (580 mum rest wavelength) continuum is not detected with a 3 sigma upper limit of 0.7 mJy. We also report observations of the 450 mum continuum in PSS 2322+1944 using the SCUBA array at the JCMT. The quasar was detected with a 450 mum flux density of 79 Â± 19 mJy. At the angular resolution of 4farcs8 x 2farcs1 at 1.3 mm and 6farcs2 x 4farcs9 at 3.2 mm, the interferometer observations do not show evidence of spatial extension in the continuum or CO line emission. Assuming no gravitational magnification, we estimate a molecular gas mass of ~ 2.5 x 10^11 M_sun. The molecular gas is warm (40 - 100 K) and dense (10^3.5 - 10^4.1 cm^-3). The infrared-to-CO luminosity ratio is ~ 185 L_sun (K km s^-1 pc^2)^-1, comparable to the values found for ultraluminous infrared galaxies. The detection of CO emission in this high redshift QSO provides further evidence that the radio emission and the millimeter to submillimeter continuum emission are predominantly powered by a starburst which is coeval with the AGN activity.</abstract>

        <abstract>An exquisite gravitational arc with a radius of 2.1'' has been discovered around the z=0.938 field elliptical galaxy CFRS 03.1077 during HST observations of Canada-France Redshift Survey (CFRS) fields. Spectroscopic observations of the arc show that the redshift of the resolved lensed galaxy is z=2.941. This gravitational lens source system is well fitted using the position angle and ellipticity derived from the visible matter distribution and an isothermal mass profile with a mass corresponding to sigma=387Â±5 km s^-1. Surprisingly, given the evidence for passive evolution of elliptical galaxies, this is in good agreement with an estimate based on the fundamental plane for z=0 ellipticals. This, perhaps, indicates that this galaxy has not shared in the significant evolution observed for average elliptical galaxies at z~1. A second elliptical galaxy with similar luminosity from the CFRS survey, CFRS 14.1311 at z=0.807, is also a lens, but in this case the lens model gives a much smaller mass-to-light ratio; i.e., it appears to confirm the expected evolution. This suggests that this pair of field elliptical galaxies may have very different evolutionary histories, which would be a significant result if confirmed. Clearly, CFRS 03.1077 demonstrates that these ''Einstein rings'' are powerful probes of high-redshift galaxies. Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.</abstract>

        <abstract>H-band observations with a spatial resolution of 0.15'' carried out with the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope adaptive optics system show a galaxy between the components of the double broad absorption line QSO SBS 1520+530, thereby confirming this system as a gravitational lens. The galaxy is located 0.40'' from the fainter of the two QSO images and is offset 0.12'' from the line joining them. The H magnitude of the lensing galaxy is ~1 mag fainter than expected from the velocity dispersion derived for the lensing galaxy were it at z = 0.72 or z = 0.81, the redshifts of the two absorption-line systems.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report the discovery of four very bright, strongly lensed galaxies found via systematic searches for arcs in Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 5 and 6. These were followed up with spectroscopy and imaging data from the Astrophysical Research Consortium 3.5 m telescope at Apache Point Observatory and found to have redshift z &amp;gt; 2.0. With isophotal magnitudes r = 19.2-20.4 and 3'' diameter magnitudes r = 20.0-20.6, these systems are some of the brightest and highest surface brightness lensed galaxies known in this redshift range. In addition to the magnitudes and redshifts, we present estimates of the Einstein radii, which range from 5farcs0 to 12farcs7, and use those to derive the enclosed masses of the lensing galaxies.</abstract>

        <abstract>The degeneracy among the disc, bulge and halo contributions to galaxy rotation curves prevents an understanding of the distribution of baryons and dark matter in disc galaxies. In an attempt to break this degeneracy, we present an analysis of the strong gravitational lens SDSS J2141-0001, discovered as part of the Sloan Lens ACS survey. The lens galaxy is a high-inclination, disc-dominated system. We present new Hubble Space Telescope multicolour imaging, gas and stellar kinematics data derived from long-slit spectroscopy and K-band laser guide star adaptive optics imaging, both from the Keck telescopes. We model the galaxy as a sum of concentric axisymmetric bulge, disc and halo components and infer the contribution of each component, using information from gravitational lensing and gas kinematics. This analysis yields a best-fitting total (disc plus bulge) stellar mass of log_10(M_*/M_â) = 10.99^+0.11_- 0.25. The photometric data combined with stellar population synthesis models yield log_10(M_*/M_â) = 10.97 Â± 0.07 and 11.21 Â± 0.07 for the Chabrier and Salpeter initial mass functions (IMFs), respectively. Assuming no cold gas, a Salpeter IMF is marginally disfavoured, with a Bayes factor of 2.7. Accounting for the expected gas fraction of ~e 20 per cent reduces the lensing plus kinematics stellar mass by 0.10 Â± 0.05 dex, resulting in a Bayes factor of 11.9 in favour of a Chabrier IMF. The dark matter halo is roughly spherical, with minor to major axis ratio q_3, h= 0.91^+0.15_- 0.13. The dark matter halo has a maximum circular velocity of V_max= 276^+17_- 18 km s^-1, and a central density parameter of log_10Delta_V/2= 5.9^+0.9_- 0.5. This is higher than predicted for uncontracted dark matter haloes in Lambda cold dark matter cosmologies, log_10Delta_V/2= 5.2, suggesting that either the halo has contracted in response to galaxy formation, or that the halo has a higher than average concentration. Larger samples of spiral galaxy strong gravitational lenses are needed in order to distinguish between these two possibilities. At 2.2 disc scalelengths the dark matter fraction is f_DM= 0.55^+0.20_- 0.15, suggesting that SDSS J2141-0001 is submaximal. Based in part on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by AURA, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555. These observations are associated with programmes 10587 and 11978.</abstract>

        <abstract>We model the extremely massive and luminous lens galaxy in the Cosmic Horseshoe Einstein ring system J1004+4112, recently discovered in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We use the semilinear method of Warren \amp Dye, which pixelizes the source surface brightness distribution, to invert the Einstein ring for sets of parametrized lens models. Here, the method is refined by exploiting Bayesian inference to optimise adaptive pixelization of the source plane and to choose between three differently parametrized models: a singular isothermal ellipsoid, a power-law model and a Navarro, Frenk \amp White (NFW) profile. The most probable lens model is the power law with a volume mass density rho ~ r^-1.96Â±0.02 and an axis ratio of ~0.8. The mass within the Einstein ring (i.e. within a cylinder with projected distance of ~30 kpc from the centre of the lens galaxy) is (5.02 Â± 0.09) \times 10^12M _solar, and the mass-to-light ratio is ~30. Even though the lens lies in a group of galaxies, the preferred value of the external shear is almost zero. This makes the Cosmic Horseshoe unique amongst large separation lenses, as almost all the deflection comes from a single, very massive galaxy with little boost from the environment.</abstract>

        <abstract>We discuss the X-ray and optical properties of the massive galaxy cluster MACSJ1206.2-0847 (z = 0.4385), discovered in the Massive Cluster Survey (MACS). Our Chandra observation of the system yields a total X-ray luminosity of 2.4 times 10^45ergs^-1 (0.1-2.4 keV) and a global gas temperature of 11.6 Â± 0.7keV, very high values typical of MACS clusters. In both optical and X-ray images, MACSJ1206.2-0847 appears close to relaxed in projection, with a pronounced X-ray peak at the location of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG); we interpret this feature as the remnant of a cold core. A spectacular giant gravitational arc, 15 arcsec in length, bright (V ~ 21) and unusually red (R - K = 4.3), is seen 20 arcsec west of the BCG; we measure a redshift of z = 1.036 for the lensed galaxy. From our Hubble Space Telescope image of the cluster, we identify the giant arc and its counter image as a sevenfold imaged system. An excess of X-ray emission in the direction of the arc coincides with a mild galaxy overdensity and could be the remnant of a minor merger with a group of galaxies. We derive estimates of the total cluster mass as well as of the mass of the cluster core using X-ray, dynamical and gravitational-lensing techniques. For the mass enclosed by the giant arc (r &lt; 119 kpc), our strong-lensing analysis based on Hubble Space Telescope imaging yields a very high value of 1.1 times 10^14M_solar, inconsistent with the much lower X-ray estimate of 0.5 times 10^14M_solar. Similarly, the virial estimate of 4 times 10^15M_solar for the total cluster mass, derived from multi-object spectroscopy with Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) and the VLT of 38 cluster members, is significantly higher than the corresponding X-ray estimate of 1.7 times 10^15M_solar. We take the discrepancy between X-ray and other mass estimates to be indicative of pronounced substructure along the line of sight during an ongoing merger event, an interpretation that is supported by the system's very high velocity dispersion of 1580 km s^-1.

        <abstract>In this work we analyze the mass distribution of MACSJ1206.2-0847, especially focusing on the halo properties of its cluster members. The cluster appears relaxed in its X-ray emission, but has significant amounts of intracluster light which is not centrally concentrated, suggesting that galaxy-scale interactions are still ongoing despite the overall relaxed state. The cluster lenses 12 background galaxies into multiple images and one galaxy at \z=1.033\ into a giant arc and its counterimage. The multiple image positions and the surface brightness distribution (SFB) of the arc which is bent around several cluster members are sensitive to the cluster galaxy halo properties. We model the cluster mass distribution with a NFW profile and the galaxy halos with two parameters for the mass normalization and extent of a reference halo assuming scalings with their observed NIR--light. We match the multiple image positions at an r.m.s. level of \0.85\backslasharcsec\ and can reconstruct the SFB distribution of the arc in several filters to a remarkable accuracy based on this cluster model. The length scale where the enclosed galaxy halo mass is best constrained is about 5 effective radii -- a scale in between those accessible to dynamical and field strong lensing mass estimates on one hand and galaxy--galaxy weak lensing results on the other hand. The velocity dispersion and halo size of a galaxy with \m\_\\backslashrm 160W,AB\=19.2\ or \M\_\\backslashrm B,Vega\=-20.7\ are \\backslashsigma=150 \backslashrm kms^\-1\\ and \r\backslashapprox 26\backslashpm 6 \backslashrm kpc\, indicating that the halos of the cluster galaxies are tidally stripped. We also reconstruct the unlensed source (which is smaller by a factor of \\backslashsim5.8\ in area), demonstrating the increase of morphological information due to lensing and conclude that this galaxy has likely star--forming spiral arms with a red (older) central component.</abstract>

        <abstract>Aims.To provide the observational constraints required to use the gravitationally lensed quasar SDSS J0924+0219 for the determination of H_0 from the time delay method. We measure here the redshift of the lensing galaxy, we show the spectral variability of the source, and we resolve the lensed host galaxy of the source. &lt;BR /&gt;Methods.We present our VLT/FORS1 deep spectroscopic observations of the lensed quasar SDSS J0924+0219, as well as archival HST/NICMOS and ACS images of the same object. The two-epoch spectra, obtained in the Multi Object Spectroscopy (MOS) mode, allow for very accurate flux calibration and spatial deconvolution. This strategy provides spectra for the lensing galaxy and for the quasar images A and B, free of any mutual light contamination. We deconvolve the HST images as well, which reveal a double Einstein ring. The mass distributions in the lens, reconstructed in several ways, are compared. &lt;BR /&gt;Results.We determine the redshift of the lensing galaxy in SDSS J0924+0219: z\_lens = 0.394Â±0.001. Only slight spectral variability is seen in the continuum of quasar images A and B, while the C III] , Mg II and Fe II emission lines display obvious changes. The flux ratio between the quasar images A and B is the same in the emission lines and in the continuum. One of the Einstein rings found using deconvolution corresponds to the lensed quasar host galaxy at z=1.524 and a second bluer one, is the image either of a star-forming region in the host galaxy, or of another unrelated lower redshift object. A broad range of lens models give a satisfactory fit to the data. However, they predict very different time delays, making SDSS J0924+0219 an object of particular interest for photometric monitoring. In addition, the lens models reconstructed using exclusively the constraints from the Einstein rings, or using exclusively the astrometry of the quasar images, are not compatible. This suggests that multipole-like structures play an important role in SDSS J0924+0219. &lt;BR /&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>Aims:The knowledge of the redshift of a lensing galaxy that produces multiple images of a background quasar is essential to any subsequent modeling, whether related to the determination of the Hubble constant H_0 or to the mass profile of the lensing galaxy. We present the results of our ongoing spectroscopic observations of gravitationally lensed quasars in order to measure the redshift of their lensing galaxies. We report on the determination of the lens redshift in seven gravitationally lensed systems.  &lt;BR /&gt;Methods: Our deep VLT/FORS1 spectra are spatially deconvolved in order to separate the spectrum of the lensing galaxies from the glare of the much brighter quasar images. Our observing strategy involves observations in Multi-Object-Spectroscopy (MOS) mode which allows the simultaneous observation of the target and of several crucial PSF and flux calibration stars. The advantage of this method over traditional long-slit observations is that it allows a much more reliable extraction and flux calibration of the spectra. &lt;BR /&gt;Results: We obtain the first reliable spectra of the lensing galaxies in six lensed quasars: FBQ 0951+2635 (z\_lens~=0.260), BRI 0952-0115 (z\_lens~=0.632), HE 2149-2745 (z\_lens~=0.603), Q 0142-100 (z\_lens~=0.491), SDSS J0246-0825 (z\_lens~=0.723), and SDSS J0806+2006 (z\_lens~=0.573). The last three redshifts also correspond to the Mg II doublet seen in absorption in the quasar spectra at the lens redshift. Our spectroscopic redshifts of HE 2149-2745 and FBQ 0951+2635 are higher than previously reported, which means that H_0 estimates from these two systems must be revised to higher values. Finally, we reanalyse the blue side of our previously published spectra of Q 1355-2257 and find Mg II in absorption at z =0.702, confirming our previous redshift estimate. The spectra of all lenses are typical of early-type galaxies. Based on observations made with the ESO-VLT Unit Telescope 2 Kueyen (Cerro Paranal, Chile; Programs 077.A-0155, PI: G.

        <abstract>Aims.We measure the redshift of the lensing galaxy in eight gravitationally lensed quasars in view of determining the Hubble parameter H0 from the time delay method. &lt;BR /&gt;Methods.Deep VLT/FORS1 spectra of lensed quasars are spatially deconvolved in order to separate the spectrum of the lensing galaxies from the glare of the much brighter quasar images.

The advantage of this method over traditional long-slit observations is a much more reliable extraction and flux calibration of the spectra. &lt;BR /&gt;Results.For the first time we measure the redshift of the lensing galaxy in three multiply-imaged quasars: SDSS J1138+0314 (z\_lens = 0.445), SDSS J1226-0006 (z\_lens = 0.517), SDSS J1335+0118 (z\_lens = 0.440), and we give a tentative estimate of the redshift of the lensing galaxy in Q 1355-2257 (z\_lens = 0.701). We confirm four previously measured redshifts: HE 0047-1756 (z\_lens = 0.407), HE 0230-2130 (z\_lens = 0.523), HE 0435-1223 (z\_lens = 0.454) and WFI J2033-4723 (z\_lens = 0.661). In addition, we determine the redshift of the second lensing galaxy in HE 0230-2130 (z\_lens = 0.526). The spectra of all lens galaxies are typical for early-type galaxies, except for the second lensing galaxy in HE 0230-2130 which displays prominent [OII] emission. &lt;BR /&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>We (Elston et al. 1993) have observed the rest frame optical and UV spectra of the luminous, high redshift IRAS galaxy FSC10214+4724. We find the [NII]/Halpha and [OIII]/Hbeta emission line ratios to be typical of those found in Seyfert II galaxies. The large Halpha /Hbeta ratio suggests substantial reddening of the narrow line region. The rest-frame optical emission is unpolarized (P=2.6Â±3.0\%). These properties are very similar to those of the infrared luminous galaxies found at lower redshift, suggesting that FSC10214+4724 is the luminous extreme of the same population. A deep 1.6microns image of the field shows FSC10214+4724 to be unresolved with two nearby companions and several other faint objects within 10('') of the point source. These could be a a foreground group of galaxies or galaxies physically associated with FSC10214+4724. This aggregate of objects may have contributed some of the far-infrared flux detected within the large beam of IRAS. If there is a foreground group gravitational lensing may contribute to the large luminosity of FSC10214+4724.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present the results of a search for gravitationally lensed giant arcs conducted on a sample of 825 SDSS galaxy clusters. Both a visual inspection of the images and an automated search were performed, and no arcs were found. This result is used to set an upper limit on the arc probability per cluster. We present selection functions for our survey, in the form of arc detection efficiency curves plotted as functions of arc parameters, for both the visual inspection and the automated search. The selection function is such that we are sensitive only to long, high surface brightness arcs with g-band surface brightness mu_g&amp;lt;=24.8 and length-to-width ratio l/w&amp;gt;=10. Our upper limits on the arc probability are compatible with previous arc searches. Finally, we report on a serendipitous discovery of a giant arc in the SDSS data, known inside the SDSS Collaboration as Hall's arc.</abstract>

        <abstract>We examine the wavelength dependence of flux ratios for six gravitationally lensed quasars using K and L' images obtained at the Gemini North 8 m telescope. We select lenses with source redshifts z_s &amp;lt; 2.8 so that K-band images probe rest-frame optical emission from accretion disks, while L'-band images probe rest-frame near-infrared flux emitted (in part) from the more extended surrounding torus. Since the observations correspond to different source sizes, the K and L' flux ratios are sensitive to structure on different scales and may be useful for studying small structure in the lens galaxies. Four of the six lenses show differences between K and L' flux ratios. In HE 0435-1223, SDSS 0246-0825, and HE 2149-2745, the differences may be attributable to known microlensing and/or intrinsic variability. In SDSS 0806+2006, the wavelength dependence is not easily attributed to known variations and may indicate the presence of substructure. By contrast, in Q0142-100 and SBS 0909+523 the K and L' flux ratios are consistent within the uncertainties. We discuss the utility of the current data for studying chromatic effects related to microlensing, dust extinction, and dark matter substructure.</abstract>

        <abstract>We investigate the properties of dark matter substructure in the gravitational lens HE 0435-1223 (z_l=0.455) via its effects on the positions and flux ratios of the quadruply imaged background quasar (z_s= 1.689). We start with a smooth mass model, add individual, truncated isothermal clumps near the lensed images and use the Bayesian evidence to compare the quality of different models. Compared with smooth models, models with at least one clump near image A are strongly favoured. The mass of this clump within its Einstein radius is log_10(M^A_Ein) = 7.65^+0.87_- 0.84 (in units of h^-1_70 M_â). The Bayesian evidence provides weaker support for a second clump near image B, with log_10(M^B_Ein) = 6.55^+1.01_- 1.51. We also examine models with a full population of substructure, and find the mass fraction in substructure at the Einstein radius to be f_sub&amp;gt;rsim 0.000 77, assuming the total clump masses follow a mass function dN/dM\propM^-1.9 over the range M= 10^7-10^10 M_â. Few-clump and population models produce similar Bayesian evidence values, so neither type of model is objectively favoured.</abstract>

        <abstract>We have discovered a new gravitational lens in the Cosmic Lens All-Sky Survey (CLASS). The lens B2045+265 is a four-image system with a maximum separation of 1.9". A fifth radio component is detected, but its radio spectrum and its positional coincidence with infrared emission from the lensing galaxy strongly suggest that it is the radio core of the lensing galaxy. This implies that the B2045+265 lens system consists of a flat-spectrum radio source that is being lensed by another flat-spectrum radio source. Infrared images taken with the Hubble Space Telescope and the Keck I Telescope detect the lensed images of the background source and the lensing galaxy. The lensed images have relative positions and flux densities that are consistent with those seen at radio wavelengths. The lensing galaxy has magnitudes of J=19.2, m_F160W=18.8, and K=17.6 mag in a 1.9" diameter aperture, which corresponds to the size of the Einstein ring of the lens. Spectra of the system taken with the Keck I Telescope reveal a lens redshift of z_l=0.8673 and a source redshift of z_s=1.28. The lens spectrum is typical of an Sa galaxy. The image splitting and system redshifts imply that the projected mass inside the Einstein radius of the lensing galaxy is M_E=4.7x10^11 h^-1 M_solar. An estimate of the light emitted inside the Einstein radius from the K magnitude gives a mass-to-light ratio in the rest-frame B band of (M/L_B)_E=20h(M/L_B)_solar. Both the mass and mass-to-light ratio are higher than what is seen in nearby Sa galaxies. In fact, the implied rotation velocity for the lensing galaxy is 2-3 times higher than what is seen in nearby spiral galaxies. The large projected mass inside the Einstein ring radius may be the result of a significant amount of dark matter in the system, perhaps from a compact group of galaxies associated with the primary lensing galaxy; however, it may also arise from a misidentification of the source redshift. A simple model of the gravitational potential of the lens reproduces the image positions well, but further modeling is required to satisfy the constraints from the image flux density ratios. With further observations and modeling, this lens may yield an estimate of H_0.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present spectra of three gravitational lens systems taken with the Low Resolution Imaging Spectrograph on the Keck telescopes. All of the systems were discovered in the JVAS and CLASS radio surveys, which were designed to find lenses suitable for measuring H0. Previous spectra of these systems had low SNRs, and only one of the source redshifts was secure. Our observations provide unambiguous lens and source redshifts for all of the systems, with (zl, zs) = (0.4060, 1.339), (0.5990, 1.535), and (0.4144, 1.589) for B0712+472, B1030+074, and B1600+434, respectively. The observed image splittings in the systems imply that the masses of the lensing galaxies within their Einstein rings are 5.4 x 10 exp 10, 1.2 x 10 exp 11, and 6.3 x 10 exp 10/h M(solar). The resulting V-band mass-to-light ratios for B0712+472 and B1030+074, measured inside their Einstein ring radii, are about 10 h(M/L)(solar),V, slightly higher than values observed in nearby elliptical galaxies. For B1600+434, the mass-to-light ratio is 48 h (M/L)(solar),V. This high value can be explained, at least in part, by the prominent dust lane running through the galaxy. Two of the three lens systems show evidence of variability, so monitoring may yield a time delay and thus a measurement of H0.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report the discovery of four groups of galaxies along the line of sight to the B1608+656 gravitational lens system. One group is at the redshift of the primary lensing galaxy (z=0.631) and appears to have a low mass, with eight spectroscopically confirmed members and an estimated velocity dispersion of 150Â±60 km s^-1. The three other groups are in the foreground of the lens. These groups contain ~10 confirmed members each and are located at redshifts of 0.265, 0.426, and 0.52. Two of the three additional groups are centered roughly on the lens system, while the third is centered ~1' south of the lens. We investigate the effect of each of the four groups on the gravitational lensing potential of the B1608+656 system, with a particular focus on the implications for the value of H_0 derived from this system. We find that each group provides an external convergence of ~0.005-0.060, depending on the assumptions made in the calculation. For the B1608+656 system, the stellar velocity dispersion of the lensing galaxy has been measured, thus breaking the mass sheet degeneracy due to the group that is physically associated with the lens. The effect of the other groups along the line of sight can be folded into the overall uncertainties due to large-scale structure (LSS) along the line of sight. Because B1608+656 appears to lie along an overdense line of sight, the LSS will cause the measurement of H_0 to be biased high for this system. This effect could be 5% or greater. Based in part on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555. These observations are associated with program GO-10158.</abstract>

        <abstract>We compare galaxy number counts in Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) fields containing moderate-redshift (0.2 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 1.0) strong gravitational lenses with those in two control samples: (1) the first square degree of the COSMOS survey, comprising 259 ACS fields and (2) 20 lsquopure-parallelsquo fields randomly located on the sky. Through a Bayesian analysis we determine the expectation values (mu_0) and confidence levels of the underlying number counts for a range of apertures and magnitude bins. Our analysis has produced the following results: (i) we infer that our control samples are not consistent, with the number counts in the COSMOS sample being significantly higher than in the pure-parallel sample for 21 â¤F814Wâ¤ 23. This result matches those found in previous analyses of COSMOS data using different techniques. (ii) We find that small-sized apertures, centred on strong lenses, are overdense compared with randomly placed apertures in the control samples, even compared to the COSMOS sample. Correcting for the local clustering of elliptical galaxies, based on the average two-point correlation function, reduces this overdensity to the 1-2sigma level. Thus, the overdensity of galaxies seen along a typical line of sight to a lens can be explained mostly by the natural clustering of galaxies, rather than being due to lenses lying along otherwise biased lines of sight. However, a larger sample of lenses is needed to see if the remaining bias persists when the lens-field uncertainties are smaller. (iii) There is considerable scatter in the lines of sight to individual lens systems, but quantities that are linearly dependent on the external convergence (e.g. H_0) should become unbiased if the extra galaxies that cause the bias can be accounted for in the lens models either through direct modelling or via an informed prior on the external convergence. The number counts can be used to set such an informed prior.</abstract>

        <abstract>Previous observations of the environments of the lensing galaxies in gravitational lens systems suggest that many of the lensing galaxies are associated with small groups of galaxies. As a result, we have begun a coordinated program to study the local environments of all known gravitational lens systems. In this paper, we present results on the gravitational lens system CLASS B0712+472, which has previously measured source and lens redshifts of (z_l,z_s)=(0.4060,1.339). Although we have not found a galaxy group associated with the primary lensing galaxy, we have found a foreground group that is spatially coincident with the lens system. Based on multiobject spectroscopy taken at the Keck 10 m telescope, we have confirmed 10 group members with a mean redshift of z=0.2909. The resulting velocity dispersion and estimated virial mass are 306^+110_-58 km s^-1 and 3.0^+2.2_-1.2x10^13 h^-1 M_solar, respectively, for (Omega_m,Omega_Lambda)=(0.2,0.0). The dynamical properties of this moderate-redshift group are completely consistent with the range of values found in nearby groups of galaxies. Five of the group members are red elliptical-like galaxies, while the remaining five are active star-forming galaxies. Based on the spectroscopic results and the publicly available Hubble Space Telescope imaging of nine group members, we find that the early-type fraction is 40%. We estimate that the effect of this foreground group on the gravitational lensing potential of B0712+472 is small, producing an external shear that is only a few percent, although the shear could be larger if the group centroid is significantly closer to the lens system than it appears to be.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report the serendipitous discovery of two strong gravitational lens candidates (ACS J160919+6532 and ACS J160910+6532) in deep images obtained with the Advanced Camera for Surveys on the Hubble Space Telescope, each less than 40" from the previously known gravitational lens system CLASS B1608+656. The redshifts of both lens galaxies have been measured with Keck and Gemini: one is a member of a small galaxy group at z~0.63 that also includes the lensing galaxy in the B1608+656 system, and the second is a member of a foreground group at z~0.43. By measuring the effective radii and surface brightnesses of the two lens galaxies, we infer their velocity dispersions based on the passively evolving fundamental plane (FP) relation. Elliptical isothermal lens mass models are able to explain their image configurations within the lens hypothesis, with a velocity dispersion compatible with that estimated from the FP for a reasonable source-redshift range. Based on the large number of massive early-type galaxies in the field and the number density of faint blue galaxies, the presence of two additional lens systems around CLASS B1608+656 is not unlikely in hindsight. Gravitational lens galaxies are predominantly early-type galaxies, which are clustered, and the lensed quasar host galaxies are also clustered. Therefore, obtaining deep high-resolution images of the fields around known strong-lens systems is an excellent method of enhancing the probability of finding additional strong gravitational lens systems.

        <abstract>We present the results of a program to monitor the four-image gravitational lens B1608+656 with the VLA. The system was observed over a 7 month period from 1996 October to 1997 May. The 64 epochs of observation have an average spacing of 3.6 days. The light curves of the four images of the background source show that the flux density of the background source has varied at the ~5% level. We measure time delays in the system based on common features that are seen in all four light curves. The three independent time delays in the system are found to be Deltat_BA=31Â±7 days, Deltat_BC=36Â±7 days, and Deltat_BD=76^+9_-10 days at 95% confidence. The uncertainties on the time delays are determined by Monte Carlo simulations that use fake light curves that have the characteristics of the observed light curves. This is the first gravitational lens system for which three independent time delays have been measured. A companion paper presents a mass model for the lensing galaxy that correctly reproduces the observed image positions, flux density ratios, and time delay ratios. The last condition is crucial for determining H_0 with a four-image lens. We combine the time delays with the model to obtain a value for the Hubble constant of H_0=59^+8_-7 km s^-1 Mpc^-1 at 95% confidence (statistical) for (Omega_M,Omega_Lambda)=(1,0). In addition, there is an estimated systematic uncertainty of Â±15 km s^-1 Mpc^-1 from uncertainties in modeling the radial mass profiles of the lensing galaxies. The value of H_0 presented in this paper is comparable to recent measurements of H_0 from the gravitational lenses 0957+561, PG 1115+080, B0218+357, and PKS 1830-211.</abstract>

        <abstract>The gravitational lens system 1608+656 displays four flat-spectrum, pointlike components that are the images of the unresolved core of a double-lobed radio source. The lensing mass is a galaxy at z = 0.630. New spectra of this system enable us to determine a conclusive redshift of 1.394 for the lensed object. The spectra show prominent high-order Balmer absorption lines and Mg II absorption. These lines, and the absence of [O II] emission, indicate that this is a poststarburst or E + A galaxy. It is unique among lensed objects in not being a quasar and among E + A galaxies in having the highest known redshift. Even allowing for lens magnification, the lensed object is a very luminous galaxy, with an absolute magnitude, M(r) = -22.8 mag. The deconvolved infrared image indicates that the galaxy may be slightly resolved. The radio luminosity density of the lobes is L1.4 = 5.78 x 1025 W Hz-1, which puts the source on the boundary between FR I and FR II radio galaxies. Together with the redshift for the lens and a satisfactory mass model, the determination of the lensed object redshift makes this system an excellent candidate for measuring H0.</abstract>

        <abstract>The gravitational lens CLASS B1608+656 is the only four-image lens system for which all three independent time delays have been measured. This makes the system an excellent candidate for a high-quality determination of H_0 at cosmological distances. However, the original measurements of the time delays had large (12%-20%) uncertainties, due to the low level of variability of the background source during the monitoring campaign. In this paper, we present results from two additional VLA monitoring campaigns. In contrast to the ~5% variations seen during the first season of monitoring, the source flux density changed by 25%-30% in each of the subsequent two seasons. We analyzed the combined data set from all three seasons of monitoring to improve significantly the precision of the time delay measurements; the delays are consistent with those found in the original measurements, but the uncertainties have decreased by factors of 2-3. We combined the delays with revised isothermal mass models to derive a measurement of H_0. Depending on the positions of the galaxy centroids, which vary by up to 0.1" in Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images obtained with different filters, we obtain H_0=61-65 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, for (Omega_M,Omega_Lambda)=(0.3,0.7). The value of H_0 decreases by 6% if (Omega_M,Omega_Lambda)=(1.0,0.0). The formal uncertainties on H_0 due to the time-delay measurements are Â±1 (Â±2) km s^-1 Mpc^-1 for the 1 sigma (2 sigma) confidence limits. Thus, the systematic uncertainties due to the lens model, which are on the order of Â±15 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, now dominate the error budget for this system. In order to improve the measurement of H_0 with this lens, new models that incorporate the constraints provided by stellar dynamics and the optical/infrared Einstein ring seen in HST images must be developed.</abstract>

        <abstract>Aims: We report on the redshift of the lensing galaxy and of the quasar QJ 0158-4325 and on the lens model of the system. &lt;BR /&gt;Methods: A deep VLT/FORS2 spectrum and HST/NICMOS-F160W images are deconvolved. From the images we derive the light profile of the lensing galaxy and an accurate relative astrometry for the system. In addition we measure the flux ratio between the quasar images in the Mg ii emission line to constrain the mass model. &lt;BR /&gt;Results: From the spectrum we measure the redshift of the lensing galaxy (z = 0.317Â±0.001) and of the quasar (z = 1.294Â±0.008). Using the flux ratio in the lens model allows us to discard the SIE as a suitable approximation of the lens potential. On the contrary the truncated-PIEMD gives a good fit to the lens and leads to a time delay of Delta t\_A-B = -14.5 Â±0.1 days, with H_0 = 73 km s^-1 Mpc^-1. &lt;BR /&gt;Conclusions: Using the flux ratio to constrain the mass model favors the truncated-PIEMD over the SIE, while ignoring this constraint leaves the choice open.

        <abstract>Context. Nearly 100 new strong-lens candidates have been discovered in the COSMOS field. Among these, 20 lens candidates with 0.34 &amp;#8818; zlens &amp;#8818; 1.13 feature multiple images of background sources.
Aims: Using the multi-wavelength coverage of the field and its spectroscopic follow-up, we characterize the evolution with redshift of the environment and of the dark-matter (DM) fraction of the lens galaxies.
Methods: We present spectroscopic and new photometric redshifts of the strong-lens candidates. The lens environment is characterized in the following way: we account for the projected 10 closest galaxies around each lens and for galaxies with a projected distance less than 1 Mpc at the lens galaxy redshift. In both cases, we perform similar measurements on a control sample of "twin" non-lens early-type galaxies (ETGs). In addition, we identify group members and field galaxies in the X-ray and optical catalogs of galaxy groups and clusters. From those catalogs, we measure the external shear contribution of the groups/clusters surrounding the lens galaxies. The systems are then modeled using a singular isothermal ellipsoid for the lens galaxies plus the external shear produced by the groups/clusters.
Results: We observe that the average stellar mass of lens galaxies increases with redshift. In addition, we measure that the environment of lens galaxies is compatible with that of the twins over the whole redshift range tested here. During the lens modeling, we notice that when let free, the external shear points in a direction which is the mean direction of the external shear produced by the groups/clusters and of the closest galaxy to the lens. We also notice that the DM fraction of the lens galaxies measured within the Einstein radius significantly decreases as the redshift increases.
Conclusions: Given these observations, we conclude that while the environment of lens galaxies is compatible with that of non-lens ETGS over a wide range of redshifts, their mass properties evolves significantly with redshift: it is still not clear whether this advocates in favor of a stronger lensing bias toward massive objects at high redshift or if it is simply representative of the high proportion of massive and high stellar density galaxies at high redshift.

        <abstract>The anomalous flux ratios between quasar images are suspected of being caused by substructures in lens galaxies. We present new deep and high-resolution H and Ks imaging of the strongly lensed quasar SDSS J0924+0219 obtained using the ESO VLT with adaptive optics and the laser guide star system. SDSS J0924+0219 is particularly interesting because the observed flux ratio between the quasar images vastly disagree with the predictions from smooth mass models. With our adaptive optics observations we find a luminous object, Object L, located ~0.3'' to the north of the lens galaxy, but we show that it cannot be responsible for the anomalous flux ratios. Object L as well as a luminous extension of the lens galaxy to the south are seen in the archival HST/ACS image in the F814W filter. This suggests that Object L is part of a bar in the lens galaxy, as also supported by the presence of a significant disk component in the light profile of the lens galaxy. Finally, we find no evidence of any other luminous substructure that may explain the quasar images flux ratios. However, owing to the persistence of the flux ratio anomaly over time (~7 years), a combination of microlensing and millilensing is the favorite explanation for the observations.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present the first catalog of 67 strong galaxy-galaxy lens candidates discovered in the 1.64 deg2 Hubble Space Telescope COSMOS survey. Twenty of these systems display multiple images or strongly curved large arcs. Our initial search is performed by visual inspection of the data and is restricted, for practical considerations, to massive early-type lens galaxies with arcs found at radii smaller than ~5". Simple mass models are constructed for the best lens candidates, and our results are compared to the strong lensing catalogs of the SLACS survey and the CASTLES database. These new strong galaxy-galaxy lensing systems constitute a valuable sample to study the mass distribution of early-type galaxies and their associated dark matter halos. We further expect this sample to play an important role in the testing of software algorithms designed to automatically search for strong gravitational lenses. From our analysis a robust lower limit is derived for the expected occurrence of strong galaxy-galaxy systems in current and future space-based wide-field imaging surveys. We expect that such surveys should uncover a large number of strong lensing systems (more than 10 systems per square degree), which will allow for a detailed statistical analysis of galaxy properties and will likely lead to constraints on models of gravitational structure formation and cosmology.</abstract>

        <abstract>Gravitational lensing is an important tool for probing the mass distribution of galaxies. In this Letter, we report the discovery of a new quadruple lens HST 1411+5211 found in archived Wide-Field Planetary Camera 2 images of the galaxy cluster CL 140933+5226. If the galaxy is a cluster member, then its redshift is z=0.46 . The images of the source appear unresolved in the Wide-Field Camera, implying that the source is a quasar. We have modeled the lens as both a single galaxy and a galaxy plus a cluster. The latter model yields excellent fits to the image positions along with reasonable parameters for the galaxy and cluster, making HST 1411+5211 a likely gravitational lens. Determination of the source redshift and confirmation of the lens redshift would allow us to put strong constraints on the mass distribution of the lensing galaxy.</abstract>

        <abstract>We identify near-infrared K_s-band counterparts to Herschel Astrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey (H-ATLAS) submillimetre (submm) sources, using a preliminary object catalogue from the VISTA Kilo-degree Infrared Galaxy (VIKING) survey. The submm sources are selected from the H-ATLAS Phase 1 catalogue of the Galaxy and Mass Assembly 9-h field, which includes all objects detected at 250, 350 or ? with the instrument. We apply and discuss a likelihood ratio method for VIKING candidates within a search radius of 10 arcsec of the 22 000 SPIRE sources with a 5sigma detection at ?. We estimate the fraction of SPIRE sources with a counterpart above the magnitude limit of the VIKING survey to be Q_0\ap 0.73. We find that 11 294 (51 per cent) of the SPIRE sources have a best VIKING counterpart with a reliability Rââ¥ 0.8, and the false identification rate of these is estimated to be 4.2 per cent. We expect to miss \tilde5 per cent of true VIKING counterparts. There is evidence from Z-J and J-K_s colours that the reliable counterparts to SPIRE galaxies are marginally redder than the field population. We obtain photometric redshifts for \tilde68 per cent of all (non-stellar) VIKING candidates with a median redshift of ?. We have spectroscopic redshifts for 3147 (\tilde28 per cent) of the reliable counterparts from existing redshift surveys. Comparing to the results of the optical identifications supplied with the Phase 1 catalogue, we find that the use of medium-deep near-infrared data improves the identification rate of reliable counterparts from 36 to 51 per cent. Herschel is an ESA space observatory with science instruments provided by European-led Principal Investigator consortia and with important participation from NASA. VISTA is an ESO near-infrared telescope in Chile.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present single-epoch multiwavelength optical-near-infrared observations of the 'anomalous' lensed quasar SDSS J0924+0219, made using the Magellan 6.5-m Baade Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile. The data clearly resolve the anomalous bright image pair in the lensed system, and exhibit a strong decrease in the anomalous flux ratio with decreasing wavelength. This is interpreted as a result of microlensing of a source of decreasing size in the core of the lensed quasar. We model the radius of the continuum emission region, sigma, as a power law in wavelength, sigma ~ lambda^zeta. We place an upper limit on the Gaussian radius of the u'-band emission region of 3.04 	imes 10^16h^-1/2_70 (&amp;lt;M&amp;gt;/M_solar)^1/2 cm, and constrain the size-wavelength power-law index to zeta &amp;lt; 1.34 at 95 per cent confidence. These observations rule out an alpha-disc prescription for the accretion disc in SDSS J0924+0219 with 94 per cent confidence. This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5-m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.

        <abstract>We present 107 new epochs of optical monitoring data for the four brightest images of the gravitational lens SDSS J1004+4112 observed between 2006 October and 2007 June. Combining this data with the previously obtained light curves, we determine the time delays between images A, B, and C. We confirm our previous measurement, that B leads A by Deltatau_BA=40.6Â±1.8 days, and find that image C leads image A by Deltatau_CA=821.6Â±2.1 days. The lower limit on the remaining delay is that image D lags image A by Deltatau_AD&amp;gt;1250 days. Based on the microlensing of images A and B, we estimate that the accretion disk size at a rest wavelength of 2300 AA is 10^14.8Â±0.3 cm for a disk inclination of cosi=1/2, which is consistent with the microlensing disk size-black hole mass correlation function given our estimate of the black hole mass from the Mg II line width of logM_BH/M_solar=8.4Â±0.2. The long delays allow us to fill in the seasonal gaps and assemble a continuous, densely sampled light curve spanning 5.7 yr whose variability implies a structure function with a logarithmic slope of beta=0.52Â±0.02. As C is the leading image, sharp features in the C light curve can be intensively studied 2.3 yr later in the A/B pair, potentially allowing detailed reverberation mapping studies of a quasar at minimal cost.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present 426 epochs of optical monitoring data spanning 1000 days from 2003 December to 2006 June for the gravitationally lensed quasar SDSS J1004+4112. The time delay between the A and B images is Deltat_BA=38.4Â±2.0 days (Deltachi^2=4) in the expected sense that B leads A and the overall time ordering is C-B-A-D-E. The measured delay invalidates all published models. The models probably failed because they neglected the perturbations from cluster member galaxies. Models including the galaxies can fit the data well, but conclusions about the cluster mass distribution should await the measurement of the longer, and less substructure sensitive, delays of the C and D images. For these images, a delay of Deltat_CB~=681Â±15 days is plausible but requires confirmation, while delays of Deltat_CB&amp;gt;560 days and Deltat_AD&amp;gt;800 days are required. We clearly detect microlensing of the A/B images, with the delay-corrected flux ratios changing from m_B-m_A=0.44Â±0.01 mag in the first season to 0.29Â±0.01 mag in the second season and 0.32Â±0.01 mag in the third season.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present 279 epochs of optical monitoring data spanning 5.4 years from January 2007 to June 2012 for the largest image separation (22.''6) gravitationally lensed quasar, SDSS J1029+2623. We find that image A leads the images B and C by t\_AB = (744 \backslashpm 10) days, the uncertainty includes both statistical uncertainties and systematic differences due to the choice of models. With only a \backslashsim1\% fractional error, this is in the regime where uncertainties are dominated by fluctuations in the mean line-of-sight density compared to a smooth universe rather than the measurement. We cannot separate the fainter image C from image B, but since image C trails image B by only 2-3 days in all models, the estimate of the time delay between image A and B is little affected by combining the fluxes of images B and C. There is evidence for a low level of microlensing, perhaps created by whatever satellite is responsible for the flux ratio anomaly in this system. Interpreting the delay depends on better constraining the shape of the gravitational potential using the lensed host galaxy, other lensed arcs and the structure of the X-ray emission.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present high-resolution maps of stars, dust, and molecular gas in a strongly lensed submillimeter galaxy (SMG) at z = 3.259. HATLAS J114637.9-001132 is selected from the Herschel-Astrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey (H-ATLAS) as a strong lens candidate mainly based on its unusually high 500 mum flux density (~300 mJy). It is the only high-redshift Planck detection in the 130 deg^2 H-ATLAS Phase-I area. Keck Adaptive Optics images reveal a quadruply imaged galaxy in the K band while the Submillimeter Array and the Jansky Very Large Array show doubly imaged 880 mum and CO(1\rarr0) sources, indicating differentiated distributions of the various components in the galaxy. In the source plane, the stars reside in three major kpc-scale clumps extended over ~1.6 kpc, the dust in a compact (~1 kpc) region ~3 kpc north of the stars, and the cold molecular gas in an extended (~7 kpc) disk ~5 kpc northeast of the stars. The emissions from the stars, dust, and gas are magnified by ~17, ~8, and ~7 times, respectively, by four lensing galaxies at z ~ 1. Intrinsically, the lensed galaxy is a warm (T _dust ~ 40-65 K), hyper-luminous (L _IR ~ 1.7 \times 10^13 L _&amp;#9737; star formation rate (SFR) ~2000 M _&amp;#9737; yr^--1), gas-rich (M _gas/M _baryon ~ 70\%), young (M _stellar/SFR ~ 20 Myr), and short-lived (M _gas/SFR ~ 40 Myr) starburst. With physical properties similar to unlensed z &amp;gt; 2 SMGs, HATLAS J114637.9-001132 offers a detailed view of a typical SMG through a powerful cosmic microscope.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present integral field spectroscopic observations of the quadruple-lensed QSO SDSS 1004+4112 taken with the fiber system INTEGRAL at the William Herschel Telescope on 2004 January 19. In 2003 May, a blueward enhancement in the high-ionization lines of SDSS 1004+4112A was detected, and then it faded. Our observations are the first to note a second event of similar characteristics less than 1 year after. Although initially attributed to microlensing, the resemblance among the spectra of both events and the absence of microlensing-induced changes in the continuum of component A are puzzling. The lack of a convincing explanation under the microlensing or intrinsic variability hypotheses makes the observed enhancements particularly relevant, calling for close monitoring of this object.</abstract>

        <abstract>We study the relative alignment of mass and light in a sample of 16 massive early-type galaxies at z = 0.2-0.9 that act as strong gravitational lenses. The sample was identified from deep multi-band images obtained as part of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey and as part of the Strong Lensing Legacy Survey (SL2S). Higher resolution follow-up imaging is available for a subset of 10 systems. We construct gravitational lens models and infer total enclosed mass, elongation, and position angle of the mass distribution. By comparison with the observed distribution of light we infer that there is a substantial amount of external shear with mean value langgammaextrang = 0.12 Â± 0.05, arising most likely from the environment of the SL2S lenses. In a companion paper, we combine these measurements with follow-up Keck spectroscopy to study the evolution of the stellar and dark matter content of early-type galaxies as a function of cosmic time.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present a weak-lensing analysis of 22 early-type (strong) lens galaxies, based on deep HST images obtained as part of the Sloan Lens ACS Survey. Using advanced techniques to control systematic uncertainties, we show that weak-lensing signal is detected out to ~300 h^-1 kpc (at the mean lens redshift z=0.2). We analyze blank control fields from COSMOS in the same manner, inferring that the residual systematic uncertainty in the tangential shear is less than 0.3\%. A joint strong- and weak-lensing analysis shows that the average total mass density profile is consistent with isothermal (i.e., rho~r^-2) over two decades in radius (3-300 h^-1 kpc, approximately 1-100 effective radii). This finding extends by over an order of magnitude in radius previous results, based on strong lensing and/or stellar dynamics, that luminous and dark components ''conspire" to form an isothermal mass distribution. In order to disentangle the contributions of luminous and dark matter, we fit a two-component mass model (de Vaucouleurs+NFW) to the weak- and strong-lensing constraints. It provides a good fit to the data with only two free parameters: (1) the average stellar mass-to-light ratio M_*/L_V=4.48Â±0.46 h M_solar L^-1_solar (at z=0.2), in agreement with that expected for an old stellar population; (2) the average virial mass-to-light ratio M_vir/L_V=246^+101_-87 h M_solar L^-1_solar. Taking into account the scatter in the mass-luminosity relation, the latter result is in good agreement with semianalytical models of massive galaxy formation. The dark matter fraction inside the sphere of radius, the effective radius, is found to be 27\%Â±4\%. Our results are consistent with galaxy-galaxy lensing studies of early-type galaxies that are not strong lenses, in the 30-300 h^-1 kpc radius range. Thus, within the uncertainties, our results are representative of early-type galaxies in general.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present the results of a gravitational lensing analysis of the bright z _s = 2.957 submillimeter galaxy (SMG) HERMES found in the Herschel/SPIRE science demonstration phase data from the Herschel Multi-tiered Extragalactic Survey (HerMES) project. The high-resolution imaging available in optical and near-IR channels, along with CO emission obtained with the Plateau de Bure Interferometer, allows us to precisely estimate the intrinsic source extension and hence estimate the total lensing magnification to be \mu = 10.9 \Â± 0.7. We measure the half-light radius R _eff of the source in the rest-frame near-UV and V bands that characterize the unobscured light coming from stars and find R _eff, * = [2.0 \Â± 0.1] kpc, in good agreement with recent studies on the SMG population. This lens model is also used to estimate the size of the gas distribution (R _eff, gas = [1.1 \Â± 0.5] kpc) by mapping back in the source plane the CO (J = 5 \\rarr 4) transition line emission. The lens modeling yields a relatively large Einstein radius R _Ein = 4farcs10 \Â± 0farcs02, corresponding to a deflector velocity dispersion of [483 \Â± 16] km s^-1. This shows that HERMES is lensed by a galaxy group-size dark matter halo at redshift z _l \~ 0.6. The projected dark matter contribution largely dominates the mass budget within the Einstein radius with f _dm(\&amp;lt; R _Ein) \~ 80\\%. This fraction reduces to f _dm(\&amp;lt; R _eff, G1 \~= 4.5 kpc) \~ 47\\% within the effective radius of the main deflecting galaxy of stellar mass M _*, G1 = [8.5 \Â± 1.6] \\times 10^11 M _sun. At this smaller scale the dark matter fraction is consistent with results already found for massive lensing ellipticals at z \~ 0.2 from the Sloan Lens ACS Survey. Some of the data presented herein were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report the serendipitous discovery of an Einstein Ring in the optical band from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data and four associated images of a background source. The lens galaxy appears to be a nearby dwarf spheroid at a redshift of 0.0375 plusmn 0.002. The lensed quasar is at a redshift of 0.6842 plusmn 0.0014, and its multiple images are distributed almost 360deg around the lens nearly along a ring of radius ~6farcs0. Single-component lens models require a mass of the galaxy of almost 10^12 M _sun within 6farcs0 from the lens center. With the available data, we are unable to determine the exact positions, orientations, and fluxes of the quasar and the galaxy, though there appears to be evidence for a double- or multiple-merging image of the quasar. We have also detected strong radio and X-ray emissions from this system. It is indicative that this ring system may be embedded in a group or cluster of galaxies. This unique ring, by virtue of the closeness of the lens galaxy, offers a possible probe of some key issues such as the mass-to-light ratio of intrinsically faint galaxies and the existence of large-scale magnetic fields in elliptical galaxies.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present a catalog of 5039 broad absorption line (BAL) quasars (QSOs) in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 5 (DR5) QSO catalog that have absorption troughs covering a continuous velocity range &amp;gt;=2000 km s^-1. We have fitted ultraviolet (UV) continua and line emission in each case, enabling us to report common diagnostics of BAL strengths and velocities in the range -25, 000 to 0 km s^-1 for Si IV lambda1400, C IV lambda1549, Al III lambda1857, and Mg II lambda2799. We calculate these diagnostics using the spectrum listed in the DR5 QSO catalog, and also for spectra from additional SDSS observing epochs when available. In cases where BAL QSOs have been observed with Chandra or XMM-Newton, we report the X-ray monochromatic luminosities of these sources. We confirm and extend previous findings that BAL QSOs are more strongly reddened in the rest-frame UV than non-BAL QSOs, and that BAL QSOs are relatively X-ray weak compared to non-BAL QSOs. The observed BAL fraction is dependent on the spectral signal-to-noise ratio (S/N); for higher S/N sources, we find an observed BAL fraction of ap 15\%. BAL QSOs show a similar Baldwin effect as for non-BAL QSOs, in that their C IV emission equivalent widths decrease with increasing continuum luminosity. However, BAL QSOs have weaker C IV emission in general than do non-BAL QSOs. Sources with higher UV luminosities are more likely to have higher-velocity outflows, and the BAL outflow velocity and UV absorption strength are correlated with relative X-ray weakness. These results are in qualitative agreement with models that depend on strong X-ray absorption to shield the outflow from overionization and enable radiative acceleration. In a scenario in which BAL trough shapes are primarily determined by outflow geometry, observed differences in Si IV and C IV trough shapes would suggest that some outflows have ion-dependent structure.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present evidence for a Spitzer-selected luminous infrared galaxy (LIRG) behind the Bullet Cluster (1E0657-56). The galaxy, originally identified as a multiply imaged source using Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) photometry, has a spectral energy distribution consistent with a highly extincted (A_V ~ 3.3), strongly star forming galaxy at z = 2.7. Using our strong gravitational lensing model presented in a previous paper, we find that the magnifications are |mu| ap 10-50 for the three images of the galaxy. The brightest and faintest images differ by a factor of 3.2 in magnification. The implied infrared luminosity is consistent with the galaxy being a LIRG, with a stellar mass of M _* ~ 2 x 10^10 M _sun and a star formation rate (SFR) of ~90 M _sun yr^-1. With lensed fluxes at 24 mum of 0.58 mJy and 0.39 mJy in the two brightest images, this galaxy presents a unique opportunity for detailed study of an obscured starburst with a SFR comparable to that of L* galaxies at z gt 2. This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile, the Hubble Space Telescope, and the Spitzer Space Telescope.</abstract>

        <abstract>The galaxy cluster IDCS J1426.5+3508 at z = 1.75 is the most massive galaxy cluster yet discovered at z &amp;gt; 1.4 and the first cluster at this epoch for which the Sunyaev-Zel'Dovich effect has been observed. In this paper, we report on the discovery with Hubble Space Telescope imaging of a giant arc associated with this cluster. The curvature of the arc suggests that the lensing mass is nearly coincident with the brightest cluster galaxy, and the color is consistent with the arc being a star-forming galaxy. We compare the constraint on M _200 based upon strong lensing with Sunyaev-Zel'Dovich results, finding that the two are consistent if the redshift of the arc is z &amp;gt;~ 3. Finally, we explore the cosmological implications of this system, considering the likelihood of the existence of a strongly lensing galaxy cluster at this epoch in a LambdaCDM universe. While the existence of the cluster itself can potentially be accommodated if one considers the entire volume covered at this redshift by all current high-redshift cluster surveys, the existence of this strongly lensed galaxy greatly exacerbates the long-standing giant arc problem. For standard LambdaCDM structure formation and observed background field galaxy counts this lens system should not exist. Specifically, there should be no giant arcs in the entire sky as bright in F814W as the observed arc for clusters at z &amp;gt;= 1.75, and only ~0.3 as bright in F160W as the observed arc. If we relax the redshift constraint to consider all clusters at z &amp;gt;= 1.5, the expected number of giant arcs rises to ~15 in F160W, but the number of giant arcs of this brightness in F814W remains zero. These arc statistic results are independent of the mass of IDCS J1426.5+3508. We consider possible explanations for this discrepancy.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present near-infrared observations of the ultraluminous high-redshift (z = 2.286) IRAS source FSC 10214+4724 obtained in 0.''4 seeing at the W. M. Keck telescope. These observations show that FSC 10214+4724 consists of a highly symmetric circular arc centered on a second weaker source. The arc has an angular extent of about 140 deg and is probably unresolved in the transverse direction. This morphology constitutes compelling prima facie evidence for a gravitationally lensed system. Our images also contain evidence for the faint counterimage predicted by the lens hypothesis. The morphology of FSC 10214+4724 can be explained in terms of a gravitationally lensed background source if the object at the center of curvature of the arc is an L* galaxy at z ~ 0.7. If FSC 10214+4724 is lensed, then there is significant magnification and its luminosity has been overestimated by a large factor. Our results suggest that FSC 10214+4724 is not a uniquely luminous object but ranks among the most powerful quasars and ultraluminous IRAS galaxies.</abstract>

        <abstract>In the course of a Cycle 8 snapshot imaging survey with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS), we have discovered that the z=1.565 quasar HE 0512-3329 is a double with image separation 0.644'', differing in brightness by only 0.4 mag. This system is almost certainly gravitationally lensed. Although separate spectra for the two images have not yet been obtained, the possibility that either component is a Galactic star is ruled out by a high signal-to-noise composite ground-based spectrum and separate photometry for the two components: the spectrum shows no trace of any zero-redshift stellar absorption features belonging to a star with the temperature indicated by the broadband photometry. The optical spectrum shows strong absorption features of Mg II, Mg I, Fe II, Fe I, and Ca I, all at an identical intervening redshift of z=0.9313, probably due to the lensing object. The strength of Mg II and the presence of the other low-ionization absorption features is strong evidence for a damped Lyalpha system, likely the disk of a spiral galaxy. Point-spread function fitting to remove the two quasar components from the STIS image leads to a tentative detection of a third object, which may be the nucleus of the lensing galaxy. The brighter component is significantly redder than the fainter, due to either differential extinction or microlensing. Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.</abstract>

        <abstract>Context: The largest spectroscopically selected sample of strong gravitational lens systems presented and analyzed to date is that of the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) survey. For the 57 massive early-type lens galaxies in the sample, photometric and spectroscopic measurements are available from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). &lt;BR /&gt;Aims: By using the SDSS multicolor photometry and lens modeling, we study stellar-mass properties and the luminous and dark matter composition of the early-type lens galaxies in the sample. &lt;BR /&gt;Methods: We fit the lens spectral energy distributions (SEDs) consisting of ugriz magnitudes with a three-parameter grid (age, star-formation timescale, and photometric mass) of Bruzual amp Charlot's and Maraston's composite stellar-population models, computed by adopting solar metallicity and various initial mass functions (IMFs). We also utilize the best-fit parameters derived from the lens models of the total projected mass enclosed within the disk defined by the Einstein radius of each system. &lt;BR /&gt;Results: We observe that early-type lens galaxies have the same physical properties as massive non-lens galaxies. In particular, we investigate the relationships between stellar mass and both the size and the surface stellar-mass density of the lens galaxies, which are consistent with those determined for non-lens galaxies in the local Universe. We find statistically significant evidence that more luminous and massive lens galaxies tend to form in regions of higher galaxy density, as for all early-type galaxies. Interestingly, for the corresponding stellar quantities we measure the same scaling law between effective mass-to-light ratio and mass used to explain the ldquotiltdquo of the Fundamental Plane (FP), and the same evolution in the effective mass-to-light ratio with redshift as derived from the FP. We conclude that the total (luminous+dark) mass of the lenses is linearly proportional to the luminous mass, at a confidence level of more than 99\%. In addition, by assuming that the lens galaxies are homologous systems, we study their distribution of dark matter and estimate a value on the order of 30\% for the dark over total projected mass fraction contained within the average Einstein ring of radius of approximately 4 kpc. &lt;BR /&gt;Conclusions: These results suggest that early-type lens galaxies are an unbiased subsample representative of the complete sample of early-type galaxies. This allows us to generalize our findings on the amount and distribution of dark matter in lens galaxies to the population of massive early-type galaxies. For the assumed metallicity, we note that a Salpeter IMF is better suited than either a Chabrier or Kroupa IMF to describing the sample of lenses.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present high-resolution CCD images (FWHM~=0.6-0.7 arcsec) of the compact gravitational lens system B0218+35.7 obtained at the Nordic Optical Telescope. Using aperture and point spread function photometry, we detect the two closely separated (335 mas) components A and B as well as the lensing galaxy. In the optical, B seems to be very much brighter than A, in contrast to the radio structure. This suggests that most of the light from A is absorbed in the lensing galaxy, possibly by a giant molecular cloud located in the line of sight to component A. The lensing galaxy appears to be a late-type galaxy at a small inclination. For future variability studies, we present calibrated photometry of the system and its immediate surroundings, even though the relative faintness of A will make it difficult to obtain an optical time delay even with the Hubble Space Telescope.</abstract>

        <abstract>We announce the discovery of a new gravitationally lensed QSO within the Hamburg Quasar Survey (HQS). HS 0818+1227 is at redshift z = 3.115 Â± 0.001 and consists of two components separated by 2\backslashfarcs 1 with R-magnitudes of 18.6 and 19.8 respectively. The two components have identical redshifts (\backslashbigtriangleup v &amp;lt;= 220 km/s) and identical emission line spectra with a flux ratio f\_A/f\_B = 8. In particular, both have the same large OVI/CIV emission line ratio. Close to the fainter image B there is an extended source which cannot be separated from B and which contributes to the spectrum of B at lambda &amp;gt;= 5500 \"A,. Subtraction of a downscaled spectrum of A from B (f\_B - f\_A/8) reveals a residual with a spectrum similar to that of a neighbouring galaxy 5 arcsec apart which is at redshift 0.39. The system bears similarity to UM 673 where the lensing galaxy is very close to the fainter image. Further galaxies are within roughly 20\backslasharcsec. The suspected lensing galaxy (R =~ 20.6, M\_V =~ - 21.5) is apparently member of a group (chain) of galaxies with several bright members within 60 kpc * h^-1_50.

        <abstract>We present Keck II NIRSPEC rest-frame optical spectra for three recently discovered lensed galaxies: the Cosmic Horseshoe (z = 2.38), the Clone (z = 2.00), and SDSS J090122.37+181432.3 (z = 2.26). The boost in signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) from gravitational lensing provides an unusually detailed view of the physical conditions in these objects. A full complement of high S/N rest-frame optical emission lines is measured, spanning from rest frame 3600 to 6800 \AA, including robust detections of fainter lines such as Hgamma, [S II]lambda6717,6732, and in one instance [Ne III]lambda3869. SDSS J090122.37+181432.3 shows evidence for active galactic nucleus activity, and therefore we focus our analysis on star-forming regions in the Cosmic Horseshoe and the Clone. For these two objects, we estimate a wide range of physical properties. Current lensing models for the Cosmic Horseshoe and the Clone allow us to correct the measured Halpha luminosity and calculated star formation rate. Metallicities have been estimated with a variety of indicators, which span a range of values of 12+ log(O/H) = 8.3-8.8, between ~0.4 and ~1.5 of the solar oxygen abundance. Dynamical masses were computed from the Halpha velocity dispersions and measured half-light radii of the reconstructed sources. A comparison of the Balmer lines enabled measurement of dust reddening coefficients. Variations in the line ratios between the different lensed images are also observed, indicating that the spectra are probing different regions of the lensed galaxies. In all respects, the lensed objects appear fairly typical of ultraviolet-selected star-forming galaxies at z ~ 2. The Clone occupies a position on the emission-line diagnostic diagram of [O III]/Hbeta versus [N II]/Halpha that is offset from the locations of z ~ 0 galaxies. Our new NIRSPEC measurements may provide quantitative insights into why high-redshift objects display such properties. From the [S II] line ratio, high electron densities (~1000 cm^-3) are inferred compared to local galaxies, and [O III]/[O II] line ratios indicate higher ionization parameters compared to the local population. Building on previous similar results at z ~ 2, these measurements provide further evidence (at high S/N) that star-forming regions are significantly different in high-redshift galaxies, compared to their local counterparts. Based, in part, on data obtained at the W.M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and NASA, and was made possible by the generous financial support of the W.M. Keck Foundation.</abstract>

        <abstract>The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) automatically targeted as a quasar candidate the recently discovered, gravitationally lensed, extremely reddened z=2.2 quasar PMN 0134-0931. The SDSS spectrum exhibits Ca II absorption at z=0.76451, which we identify as the redshift of a lensing galaxy. Hubble Space Telescope imaging shows that components C, D, and E of the system are significantly redder than components A or B and detects faint galaxy emission between D and A+B. The redshift of the dust responsible for the reddening remains unconstrained with current data. However, we outline a model wherein lensing and differential reddening by a z=0.76451 galaxy pair can entirely explain this system.</abstract>

        <abstract>Deep optical imaging and spectroscopy have been obtained for the well known radio Einstein ring MG1131 + 0456 with the ESO/NTT. The direct CCD frames show a red emission excess at the exact location of the radio ring. Subsequent subtraction of the lensing galaxy, assumed to be an elliptical galaxy, results in the detection of an optical ring which is strikingly similar to the radio ring. Gravitational lensing models, including source reconstruction, predicts that the source is likely a radio-galaxy for which both the optical and extended radio emissions are sufficiently distorted by the foreground lensing galaxy as to produce a nearly complete ring. The present spectroscopy and broad band photometry suggest that the lensing galaxy has a spectral energy distribution typical of a nonevolved elliptical, tentatively at z of 0.85. The radio-galaxy associated with the radio-ring is likely to be an elliptical at larger redshift, tentatively of 1.13.</abstract>

        <abstract>High-redshift QSOs (quasi-stellar objects) provide information on the early history and evolution of the universe. Hazard and McMahon (1985) have demonstrated an approach for using unfiltered UK Schmidt telescope (UKST)IIIa-F low-dispersion objective prism plates in searches for QSOs at redshifts up to at least z approximately equal to 3.7. A report is presented regarding the employment of this technique in the discovery of a QSO, 1208 + 1011, with a redshift z = 3.80. This achievement indicates that redshifts exceeding 4 could soon be attained. Attention is given to a finding chart of 1208 + 1011, measured wavelengths of emission lines with corresponding redshifts, a table with QSOs having values for z which are equal to or greater than 3.3, and IIIa-F prism spectra.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report on the first results of an imaging survey to detect strong gravitational lensing targeting the richest clusters selected from the photometric data of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) with follow-up deep imaging observations from the Wisconsin-Indiana-Yale NOAO (WIYN) 3.5 m telescope and the University of Hawaii 88 inch telescope (UH88). The clusters are selected from an area of 8000 deg^2 using the red cluster sequence technique and span the redshift range 0.1 lsim z lsim 0.6, corresponding to a comoving cosmological volume of ~2 Gpc^3. Our imaging survey thus targets a volume more than an order of magnitude larger than any previous search. A total of 240 clusters were imaged of which 141 had sub-arcsecond image quality. Our survey has uncovered 16 new lensing clusters with definite giant arcs, an additional 12 systems for which the lensing interpretation is very likely, and 9 possible lenses which contain shorter arclets or candidate arcs which are less certain and will require further observations to confirm their lensing origin. Among these new systems are several of the most dramatic examples of strong gravitational lensing ever discovered, with multiple bright arcs at large angular separation. These will likely become ''poster-child'' gravitational lenses similar to Abell 1689 and CL0024+1654. The new lenses discovered in this survey will enable future systematic studies of the statistics of strong lensing and their implications for cosmology and our structure formation paradigm.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present a sample of 221 new quasar pairs with proper transverse separations R_prop&amp;lt;1 h^-1 Mpc over the redshift range 0.5&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;3.0, discovered from an extensive follow-up campaign to find companions around the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and 2dF QSO Redshift Survey quasars. This sample includes 26 new binary quasars with separations R_prop&amp;lt;50 h^-1 kpc (thetas&amp;lt;10^"), more than doubling the number of such systems known. We define a statistical sample of binaries selected with homogeneous criteria and compute its selection function, taking into account sources of incompleteness. The first measurement of the quasar correlation function on scales 10 h^-1 kpc&amp;lt;R_prop&amp;lt;400 h^-1 kpc is presented. For R_prop&amp;lt;~40 h^-1 kpc, we detect an order of magnitude excess clustering over the expectation from the large-scale (R_prop&amp;gt;~3 h^-1 Mpc) quasar correlation function, extrapolated down as a power law (gamma=1.53) to the separations probed by our binaries. The excess grows to ~30 at R_prop~10 h^-1 kpc and provides compelling evidence that the quasar autocorrelation function gets progressively steeper on submegaparsec scales. This small-scale excess can likely be attributed to dissipative interaction events that trigger quasar activity in rich environments. Recent small-scale measurements of galaxy clustering and quasar-galaxy clustering are reviewed and discussed in relation to our measurement of small-scale quasar clustering.</abstract>

        <abstract>The discovery of extremely unusual structure in the radio source MG1131+0456 is reported. In a radio map with subsarcsecond resolution the object appears as an elliptical ring of emission accompanied by a pair of more compact sources, nearly diametrically opposed and offset by about 0.3 arcsec to the southwest of the ring. There is a faint, slightly extended, optical counterpart. A continuum but no emission lines is detected in its spectrum; therefore, the redshift of the counterpart is unknown. The radio morphology suggests that this source may be an example of an 'Einstein ring', a highly symmetric case of gravitational lensing in which the source is imaged into a ring. Other explanations are considered and excluded by the data. Another possibility is that MG1131+04565 represents a new type of astronomical object.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) 860 mum imaging of four high-redshift (z = 2.8-5.7) dusty sources that were detected using the South Pole Telescope (SPT) at 1.4 mm and are not seen in existing radio to far-infrared catalogs. At 1.''5 resolution, the ALMA data reveal multiple images of each submillimeter source, separated by 1''-3'', consistent with strong lensing by intervening galaxies visible in near-IR imaging of these sources. We describe a gravitational lens modeling procedure that operates on the measured visibilities and incorporates self-calibration-like antenna phase corrections as part of the model optimization, which we use to interpret the source structure. Lens models indicate that SPT0346-52, located at z = 5.7, is one of the most luminous and intensely star-forming sources in the universe with a lensing corrected FIR luminosity of 3.7 \times 10^13 L _sun; and star formation surface density of 4200 M _sun; yr^-1 kpc^-2. We find magnification factors of 5 to 22, with lens Einstein radii of 1.''1-2.''0 and Einstein enclosed masses of 1.6-7.2 \times 10^11 M _sun;. These observations confirm the lensing origin of these objects, allow us to measure their intrinsic sizes and luminosities, and demonstrate the important role that ALMA will play in the interpretation of lensed submillimeter sources.</abstract>

        <abstract>The authors have discovered a new gravitational lens system which consists of a quasar at z = 1.695 nearly centered on a 15 mag spiral galaxy, 2237+0305, at z = 0.0394. At 2arcsec resolution, only a single optical image of the quasar is visible; its centroid is located within approximately 0arcsec.3 of the center of the galaxy. ''Snapshot'' observations at the VLA yielded no detectable radio radiation, placing an upper limit of about 0.5 mJy on the combined flux density of the galaxy and quasar at lambda = 6 cm. The authors discuss a simple gravitational lens model that accounts for these observations.</abstract>

        <abstract>Hubble Space Telescope observations of the gravitational lens PG 1115+080 in the infrared show the known z\_l = 0.310 lens galaxy and reveal the z\_s = 1.722 quasar host galaxy. The main lens galaxy G is a nearly circular (ellipticity epsilon &amp;lt; 0.07) elliptical galaxy with a de Vaucouleurs profile and an effective radius of R\_e = 0.59'' Â± 0.06'' (1.7 Â± 0.2 h^-1 kpc for Omega\_0 = 1 and h = H\_0/100 km s^-1 Mpc^-1). G is part of a group of galaxies that is a required component of all successful lens models. The new quasar and lens positions (3 mas uncertainty) yield constraints for these models that are statistically degenerate, but several conclusions are firmly established. (1) The principal lens galaxy is an elliptical galaxy with normal structural properties, lying close to the fundamental plane for its redshift. (2) The potential of the main lens galaxy is nearly round, even when not constrained by the small ellipticity of the light of this galaxy. (3) All models involving two mass distributions place the group component near the luminosity-weighted centroid of the brightest nearby group members. (4) All models predict a time delay ratio r\_ABC ~= 1.3. (5) Our lens models predict H\_0 = 44 Â± 4 km s^-1 Mpc^-1 if the lens galaxy contains dark matter and has a flat rotation curve and H\_0 = 65 Â± 5 km s^-1 Mpc^-1 if it has a constant mass-to-light ratio. (6) Any dark halo of the main lens galaxy must be truncated near 1.5'' (4 h^-1 kpc) before the inferred H\_0 rises above ~60 km s^-1 Mpc^-1. (7) The quasar host galaxy is lensed into an Einstein ring connecting the four quasar images, whose shape is reproduced by the models. Improved near-infrared camera multiobject spectrograph (NICMOS) imaging of the ring could be used to break the degeneracy of the lens models.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report the discovery of a new gravitationally lensed quasar from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, SDSS J092455.87+021924.9 (SDSS J0924+0219). This object was selected from among known SDSS quasars by an algorithm that was designed to select another known SDSS lensed quasar (SDSS J1226-0006A,B). Five separate components, three of which are unresolved, are identified in photometric follow-up observations obtained with the Magellan Consortium's 6.5 m Walter Baade Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. Two of the unresolved components (designated A and B) are confirmed to be quasars with z=1.524; the velocity difference is less than 100 km s^-1 according to spectra taken with the W. M. Keck Observatory's Keck II Telescope at Mauna Kea, Hawaii. A third stellar component, designated C, has the colors of a quasar with redshift similar to components A and B. The maximum separation of the point sources is 1.78". The other two sources, designated G and D, are resolved. Component G appears to be the best candidate for the lensing galaxy. Although component D is near the expected position of the fourth lensed component in a four-image lens system, its properties are not consistent with being the image of a quasar at z~1.5. Nevertheless, the identical redshifts of components A and B and the presence of component C strongly suggest that this object is a gravitational lens. Our observations support the idea that a foreground object reddens the fourth lensed component and that another unmodeled effect (such as micro- or millilensing) demagnifies it, but we cannot rule out the possibility that SDSS J0924+0219 is an example of the relatively rare class of "three-component" lens systems.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report the discovery of a new two-image gravitationally lensed quasar, SDSS J024634.11-082536.2 (SDSS J0246-0825). This object was selected as a lensed quasar candidate from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) by the same algorithm that was used to discover other SDSS lensed quasars (e.g., SDSS J0924+0219). Multicolor imaging with the Magellan Consortium's Walter Baade 6.5 m telescope and spectroscopic observations using the W. M. Keck Observatory's Keck II telescope confirm that SDSS J0246-0825 consists of two lensed images (Delta thetas=1.04') of a source quasar at z=1.68. Imaging observations with the Keck I telescope and the Hubble Space Telescope reveal an extended object between the two quasar components, which is likely to be a lensing galaxy of this system. From the absorption lines in the spectra of the quasar components and the apparent magnitude of the galaxy, combined with the expected absolute magnitude from the Faber-Jackson relation, we estimate the redshift of the lensing galaxy to be z=0.724. A highly distorted ring is visible in the Hubble Space Telescope images, which is likely to be the lensed host galaxy of the source quasar. Simple mass modeling predicts the possibility that there is a small (faint) lensing object near the primary lensing galaxy. Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555. These observations are associated with HST program 9744.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report the first results of our systematic search for strongly lensed quasars using the spectroscopically confirmed quasars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Among 46,420 quasars from the SDSS Data Release 3 (~4188 deg^2), we select a subsample of 22,683 quasars that are located at redshifts between 0.6 and 2.2 and are brighter than the Galactic extinction-corrected i-band magnitude of 19.1. We identify 220 lens candidates from the quasar subsample, for which we conduct extensive and systematic follow-up observations in optical and near-infrared wavebands, in order to construct a complete lensed quasar sample at image separations between 1" and 20" and flux ratios of faint to bright lensed images larger than 10^-0.5. We construct a statistical sample of 11 lensed quasars. Ten of these are galaxy-scale lenses with small image separations (~ 1"-2") and one is a large separation (15") system which is produced by a massive cluster of galaxies, representing the first statistical sample of lensed quasars including both galaxy- and cluster-scale lenses. The Data Release 3 spectroscopic quasars contain an additional 11 lensed quasars outside the statistical sample.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report the discoveries of two two-image gravitationally lensed quasars selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey: SDSS J0806+2006 at z_s=1.540 and SDSS J1353+1138 at z_s=1.629 with image separations of Deltathetas=1.40' and Deltathetas=1.41', respectively. Spectroscopic and optical/near-infrared imaging follow-up observations show that the quasar images have identical redshifts and possess extended objects between the images that are likely to be lens galaxies at z_l~=0.6 in SDSS J0806+2006 and z_l~=0.3 in SDSS J1353+1138. The field of SDSS J0806+2006 contains several nearby galaxies that may significantly perturb the system, and SDSS J1353+1138 has an extra component near its Einstein ring that is probably a foreground star. Simple mass models with reasonable parameters reproduce the quasar positions and fluxes of both systems.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report the discoveries of the two-image gravitationally lensed quasars SDSS J074653.03+440351.3 and SDSS J140624.82+612640.9, selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). SDSS J0746+4403, which will be included in our lens sample for statistics and cosmology, has a source redshift of z_s=2.00, an estimated lens redshift of z_l~0.3, and an image separation of 1.08". SDSS J1406+6126 has a source redshift of z_s=2.13, a spectroscopically measured lens redshift of z_l=0.27, and an image separation of 1.98". We find that the two quasar images of SDSS J1406+6126 have different intervening Mg II absorption strengths, which are suggestive of large variations of absorbers on kiloparsec scales. The positions and fluxes of both lensed quasar systems are easily reproduced by simple mass models with reasonable parameter values. These objects bring to 18 the number of lensed quasars that have been discovered from the SDSS data.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present the results of deep spectroscopy for the central region of the cluster lens SDSSJ 1004+4112 with the Subaru Telescope. A secure detection of an emission line of the faint blue stellar object (component E) near the center of the brightest cluster galaxy (G1) confirms that it is the central fifth image of the lensed quasar system. In addition, we measured the stellar velocity dispersion of G1 to be sigma_* = 352Â±13km s^-1. We combined these results to obtain constraints on the mass M_BH of the putative black hole (BH) at the center of the inactive galaxy G1, and hence on the M_BH-sigma_* relation at the lens redshift z_l = 0.68. From detailed mass modeling, we placed an upper limit on the black hole mass, M_BH &amp;lt; 2.1 	imes 10^10M_odot at the 1sigma level &amp;lt; 3.1 	imes 10^10M_odot at 3sigma), which is consistent with black hole masses expected from the local and redshift-evolved M_BH-sigma_* relations, M_BH 	ilde 10^9-10^10M_odot.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report on the discovery of a fifth lensed image in the large separation lensed quasar system SDSS J1004 + 4112. A faint point source located 0."2 from the center of the brightest galaxy in the lensing cluster was detected in images taken with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) and the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) on the Hubble Space Telescope. The flux ratio between the point source and the brightest lensed component in the ACS image is similar to that in the NICMOS image. The location and brightness of the point source are consistent with lens model predictions for a lensed image. We therefore conclude that the point source is likely to be a fifth lensed image of the source quasar. In addition, the NICMOS image reveals the lensed host galaxy of the source quasar, which can strongly constrain the structure of the lensing critical curves, and thereby the mass distribution of the lensing cluster.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report the discovery of a cluster-scale lensed quasar, SDSS J1029+2623, selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The lens system exhibits two lensed images of a quasar at z_s=2.197. The image separation of 22.5' makes it the largest separation lensed quasar discovered to date. The similarity of the optical spectra and the radio loudnesses of the two components support the lensing hypothesis. Images of the field show a cluster of galaxies at z_l~0.55 that is responsible for the large image separation. The lensed images and the cluster light center are not collinear, which implies that the lensing cluster has a complex structure. Based in part on data collected at Subaru Telescope, which is operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan.</abstract>

        <abstract>Gravitational lensing is a powerful tool for the study of the distribution of dark matter in the Universe. The cold-dark-matter model of the formation of large-scale structures (that is, clusters of galaxies and even larger assemblies) predicts the existence of quasars gravitationally lensed by concentrations of dark matter so massive that the quasar images would be split by over 7arcsec. Numerous searches for large-separation lensed quasars have, however, been unsuccessful. All of the roughly 70 lensed quasars known, including the first lensed quasar discovered, have smaller separations that can be explained in terms of galaxy-scale concentrations of baryonic matter. Although gravitationally lensed galaxies with large separations are known, quasars are more useful cosmological probes because of the simplicity of the resulting lens systems. Here we report the discovery of a lensed quasar, SDSS J1004 + 4112, which has a maximum separation between the components of 14.62arcsec. Such a large separation means that the lensing object must be dominated by dark matter. Our results are fully consistent with theoretical expectations based on the cold-dark-matter model.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present the second report of our systematic search for strongly lensed quasars from the data of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). From extensive follow-up observations of 136 candidate objects, we find 36 lenses in the full sample of 77,429 spectroscopically confirmed quasars in the SDSS Data Release 5. We then define a complete sample of 19 lenses, including 11 from our previous search in the SDSS Data Release 3, from the sample of 36,287 quasars with i &amp;lt; 19.1 in the redshift range 0.6 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 2.2, where we require the lenses to have image separations of 1" &amp;lt; thetas &amp;lt; 20" and i-band magnitude differences between the two images smaller than 1.25 mag. Among the 19 lensed quasars, three have quadruple-image configurations, while the remaining 16 show double images. This lens sample constrains the cosmological constant to be Omega_Lambda = 0.84^+0.06 _-0.08(stat.)^+0.09 _-0.07(syst.) assuming a flat universe, which is in good agreement with other cosmological observations. We also report the discoveries of seven binary quasars with separations ranging from 1farcs1 to 16farcs6, which are identified in the course of our lens survey. This study concludes the construction of our statistical lens sample in the full SDSS-I data set.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present the final statistical sample of lensed quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Quasar Lens Search (SQLS). The well-defined statistical lens sample consists of 26 lensed quasars brighter than i = 19.1 and in the redshift range of 0.6 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 2.2 selected from 50,826 spectroscopically confirmed quasars in the SDSS Data Release 7 (DR7), where we restrict the image separation range to 1'' &amp;lt; thetas &amp;lt; 20'' and the i-band magnitude differences in two images to be smaller than 1.25 mag. The SDSS DR7 quasar catalog also contains 36 additional lenses identified with various techniques. In addition to these lensed quasars, we have identified 81 pairs of quasars from follow-up spectroscopy, 26 of which are physically associated binary quasars. The statistical lens sample covers a wide range of image separations, redshifts, and magnitudes, and therefore is suitable for systematic studies of cosmological parameters and surveys of the structure and evolution of galaxies and quasars.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report the discovery of five gravitationally lensed quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). All five systems are selected as two-image lensed quasar candidates from a sample of high-redshift (z gt 2.2) SDSS quasars. We confirmed their lensing nature with additional imaging and spectroscopic observations. The new systems are SDSS J0819+5356 (source redshift z_s = 2.237, lens redshift z_l = 0.294, and image separation thetas = 4farcs04), SDSS J1254+2235 (z_s = 3.626, thetas = 1farcs56), SDSS J1258+1657 (z_s = 2.702, thetas = 1farcs28), SDSS J1339+1310 (z_s = 2.243, thetas = 1farcs69), and SDSS J1400+3134 (z_s = 3.317, thetas = 1farcs74). We estimate the lens redshifts of the latter four systems to be z_l = 0.2-0.8 from the colors and magnitudes of the lensing galaxies. We find that the image configurations of all systems are well reproduced by standard mass models. Although these lenses will not be included in our statistical sample of z_s lt 2.2 lenses, they expand the number of lensed quasars which can be used for high-redshift galaxy and quasar studies.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report on the discovery of a highly luminous, broad absorption line quasar at a redshift of z = 3.87, which is positionally coincident, within 1'', with the IRAS Faint Source Catalog source F08279+5255. A chance alignment of the quasar and the IRAS source is extremely unlikely, and we argue that the optical and far-infrared flux are different manifestations of the same object. With an R-band magnitude of 15.2 and an IRAS 60 mum flux of 0.51 Jy, APM 08279+5255 is (apparently) easily the most intrinsically luminous object known, with L\_Bol ~ 5 x 10^15 L\_\sun. Optical CCD photometry of the system, taken in good seeing, shows evidence that the system is slightly elongated. Although these data are consistent with the superposition of the quasar on a vastly luminous galaxy, we argue that a more likely scenario is that the optical image implies the presence of two unresolved point sources. Such a configuration suggests that gravitational lensing may play a significant role in amplifying the intrinsic properties of the system. Point-spread function fitting of two discrete sources gives a separation of ~0.4'' and an intensity ratio ~1.1. The optical spectrum of the quasar clearly reveals the presence of three potential lensing galaxies, Mg ii absorption systems at z = 1.18 and z = 1.81, and a damped Lyalpha absorption system at z = 3.07. Additional, as yet unseen, lensing galaxies may also be present. We estimate the total amplification of the optical component to be ~40 but, owing to the larger scale of the emitting region, would expect the infrared amplification to be significantly less. Even making the conservative assumption that all wavelengths are amplified by a factor 40, APM 08279+5255 still possesses a phenomenal luminosity of &amp;gt;~10^14 L\_\sun, indicating that it belongs to a small but significant population of high-redshift, hyperluminous objects with copious infrared emission.</abstract>

        <abstract>A complete manual search has been carried out of the list of 285423 objects, nearly all of them galaxies, identified in the COSMOS field that are brighter than I=25. Two certain and one highly probable new gravitational lenses are found, in addition to the lenses and candidate lens systems previously found by Faure et al. (2008). A further list of 112 candidate lens systems is presented. Few of these are likely to be true gravitational lens systems, most being star-forming rings or pairs of companion galaxies. It is possible to examine of order 10^6 objects by eye in a reasonable time, although reliable detection of lenses by such methods is likely to be possible only with high-resolution data. The loss of completeness involved in a rapid search is estimated as up to a factor of 2, depending on the morphology of the lens candidate.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present new radio observations of the large-separation gravitationally lensed quasar SDSS J1004+4112, taken in a total of 6 hr of observations with the Expanded Very Large Array. The maps reach a thermal noise level of approximately 4 muJy. We detect four of the five lensed images at the 15-35 muJy level, representing a source of intrinsic flux density, after allowing for lensing magnification, of about 1 muJy, intrinsically probably the faintest radio source yet detected. This reinforces the utility of gravitational lensing in potentially allowing us to study nJy-level sources before the advent of the Square Kilometre Array. In an optical observation taken three months after the radio observation, image C is the brightest image, whereas the radio map shows flux density ratios consistent with previous optical observations. Future observations separated by a time delay will give the intrinsic flux ratios of the images in this source.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report the discovery of a new gravitational lens system associated with the flat-spectrum radio source 1600+434. The system has been found in a new large survey of such radio sources. It consists of a 1.4-arcsec double radio source with an associated optical double at the same position and orientation, and with an almost identical flux density ratio to that in the radio. Spectra of the light from two optical images show broad emission lines with a redshift of 1.61. The spectral data are not of sufficient quality to show that both images have identical spectra. Nevertheless, we argue that the probability that 1600+434 is indeed a lensed system is very high.</abstract>

        <abstract>A new four-image gravitational lens system, B0712+472, has been discovered during the Cosmic Lens All-Sky Survey. This system consists of four flat-spectrum radio images that are also seen on a Hubble Space Telescope (HST) image, together with the lensing galaxy. We present MERLIN, VLA and VLBA maps and WHT spectra of the system as well as the HST images. The light distribution of the lensing galaxy is highly elongated and so too is the mass distribution deduced from modelling. We suggest a redshift of ~1.33 for the lensed object; the lens redshift will require further investigation. The discovery of this new system further increases the ratio of four-image to two-image lens systems currently known, exacerbating problems of required ellipticity of matter distributions in lensing galaxies.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report the discovery of a new gravitational lens system. This object, ULAS J234311.93-005034.0, is the first to be selected by using the new UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS), together with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The ULAS J234311.93-005034.0 system contains a quasar at redshift 0.788 which is doubly imaged, with separation 1.4 arcsec. The two quasar images have the same redshift and similar, though not identical, spectra. The lensing galaxy is detected by subtracting point spread functions from R-band images taken with the Keck telescope. The lensing galaxy can also be detected by subtracting the spectra of the A and B images, since more of the galaxy light is likely to be present in the latter. No redshift is determined from the galaxy, although the shape of its spectrum suggests a redshift of about 0.3. The object's lens status is secure, due to the identification of two objects with the same redshift together with a lensing galaxy. Our imaging suggests that the lens is found in a cluster environment, in which candidate arc-like structures, that require confirmation, are visible in the vicinity. Further discoveries of lenses from the UKIDSS survey are likely as part of this programme, due to the depth of UKIDSS and its generally good seeing conditions.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present observations of a new double-image gravitational lens system, ULASJ082016.1+081216, of image separation 2.3arcsec and high (~6) flux ratio. The system is selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectroscopic quasar list using new high-quality images from the UKIRT (United Kingdom Infrared Telescope) Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS). The lensed quasar has a source redshift of 2.024, and we identify the lens galaxy as a faint red object of redshift 0.803 Â± 0.001. Three other objects from the UKIDSS survey, selected in the same way, were found not to be lens systems. Together with the earlier lens found using this method, the SDSS-UKIDSS lenses have the potential to significantly increase the number of quasar lenses found in SDSS, to extend the survey to higher flux ratios and lower separations, and to give greater completeness which is important for statistical purposes.</abstract>

        <abstract>Gravitational lens systems containing lensed quasars are important as cosmological probes, as diagnostics of structural properties of the lensing galaxies and as tools to study the quasars themselves. The largest lensed quasar sample is the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Quasar Lens Search (SQLS), drawn from the SDSS. We attempt to extend this survey using observations of lens candidates selected from a combination of the quasar sample from the SDSS and the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS). This adds somewhat higher image quality together with a wider range of wavelength for the selection process. In previous pilot surveys we observed five objects, finding two lenses; here we present further observations of 20 objects in which we find four lenses, of which two are independently discovered in SQLS. Following earlier work on the combination of these two surveys, we have refined our method and find that use of a colour-separation diagnostic, where we select for separations between components which appear to decrease in wavelength, is an efficient method to find lensed quasars and may be useful in ongoing and future large-scale strong lensing surveys with instruments such as Pan-STARRS and LSST. The new lenses have mostly high flux ratios, with faint secondaries buried in the lensing galaxy and typically 6-10 times less bright than the primary. Our survey brings the total number of lenses discovered in the SDSS quasar sample to 46, plus 13 lenses already known. This is likely to be up to 60-70 per cent of the total number of lensed quasars; we briefly discuss strategies by which the rest might be found.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present Hubble Space Telescope (HST) infrared images of four gravitational lens systems from the JVAS/CLASS gravitational lens survey and compare the new infrared HST pictures with previously published WFPC2 HST optical images and radio maps. Apart from the wealth of information that we get from the flux ratios and accurate positions and separations of the components of the lens systems, which we can use as inputs for better constraints on the lens models, we are able to discriminate between reddening and optical/radio microlensing as the possible cause of differences observed in the flux ratios of the components across the three wavelength bands. Substantial reddening has been known to be present in the lens system B1600+434 and has been further confirmed by the present infrared data. In the two systems B0712+472 and B1030+074 microlensing has been pinpointed as the main cause of the flux ratio discrepancy both in the optical/infrared and in the radio, the radio possibly caused by the substructure revealed in the lensing galaxies. In B0218+357, however, the results are still not conclusive. If we are actually seeing the two 'true' components of the lens system then the flux ratio differences are attributed to a combination of microlensing and reddening or are alternatively the result of some variability in at least one of the images. Otherwise the second 'true' component of B0218+357 may be completely absorbed by a molecular cloud and the anomalous flux density ratios and large difference in separation between the optical/infrared and radio that we see can be explained by emission either from a foreground object or from part of the lensing galaxy.</abstract>

        <abstract>The gravitational lens toward B0218+357 offers the unique possibility to study cool moderately dense gas with high sensitivity and angular resolution in a cloud that existed half a Hubble time ago. Observations of the radio continuum and six formaldehyde (H2CO) lines were carried out with the VLA, the Plateau de Bure interferometer, and the Effelsberg 100-m telescope. Three radio continuum maps indicate a flux density ratio between the two main images, A and B, of ~ 3.4 Â± 0.2. Within the errors the ratio is the same at 8.6, 14.1, and 43 GHz. The 1_01-0_00 line of para-H2CO is shown to absorb the continuum of image A. Large Velocity Gradient radiative transfer calculations are performed to reproduce the optical depths of the observed two cm-wave "K-doublet" and four mm-wave rotational lines. These calculations also account for a likely frequency-dependent continuum cloud coverage. Confirming the diffuse nature of the cloud, an n(H2) density of &lt; 1000 cm^-3 is derived, with the best fit suggesting n(H2) ~ 200 cm^-3. The H2CO column density of the main velocity component is ~5 * 10^13 cm^-2, to which about 7.5 * 10^12 cm^-2 has to be added to also account for a weaker feature on the blue side, 13 km/s apart. N(H2CO)/N(NH3) ~ 0.6, which is four times less than the average ratio obtained from a small number of local diffuse (galactic) clouds seen in absorption. The ortho-to-para H2CO abundance ratio is 2.0 - 3.0, which is consistent with the kinetic temperature of the molecular gas associated with the lens of B0218+357. With the gas kinetic temperature and density known, it is found that optically thin transitions of CS, HCN, HNC, HCO+, and N2H+ (but not CO) will provide excellent probes of the cosmic microwave background at redshift z=0.68.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report the discovery of a new gravitationally lensed quasar from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, SDSS J090334.92+502819.2. This object was targeted for SDSS spectroscopy as a luminous red galaxy, but manual examination of the spectrum showed the presence of a quasar at z~=3.6 in addition to a red galaxy at z=0.388, and the SDSS image showed a second possible quasar image nearby. Follow-up imaging and spectroscopy confirmed the lensing hypothesis. In images taken at the Astrophysical Research Consortium 3.5 m telescope, two quasars are separated by 2.8" the lensing galaxy is clearly seen and is blended with one of the quasar images. Spectroscopy taken at the Keck II telescope shows that the quasars have identical redshifts of z~=3.6, and both show the presence of the same broad absorption line-like troughs. We present simple lens models that account for the geometry and magnifications. The lens galaxy lies near two groups of galaxies and may be a part of them. The models suggest that the groups may contribute considerable shear that has a strong effect on the lens configuration.</abstract>

        <abstract>We propose a novel technique to refine the modelling of galaxy cluster mass distribution using gravitational lensing. The idea is to combine the strengths of both 'parametric' and 'non-parametric' methods to improve the quality of the fit. We develop a multiscale model that allows sharper contrast in regions of higher density where the number of constraints is generally higher. Our model consists of (i) a multiscale grid of radial basis functions with physically motivated profiles and (ii) a list of galaxy-scale potentials at the location of the cluster member galaxies. This arrangement of potentials of different sizes allows us to reach a high resolution for the model with a minimum number of parameters. We apply our model to the well-studied cluster Abell 1689. We estimate the quality of our mass reconstruction with a Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampler. For a selected subset of multiple images, we manage to halve the errors between the positions of predicted and observed images compared to previous studies. This is due to the flexibility of multiscale models at intermediate scale between cluster and galaxy scale. The software developed for this paper is part of the public LENSTOOL package which can be found at http://www.oamp.fr/cosmology/lenstool.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present deep Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) OH and Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) HI absorption spectra of the z= 0.6846 gravitational lens toward B0218+357. Both the 1665- and 1667-MHz OH lines are clearly detected for the first time, while a new wide absorption component was detected (at low significance) in the HI spectrum; the OH spectra yielded an OH column density of N_OH= 2.3 x 10^15 cm^-2. The ratio of 1667- and 1665-MHz equivalent widths is ~1.8 while the redshift of peak OH absorption is z= 0.68468 Â± 0.000008 for both lines; this redshift agrees with that obtained from the HI line. The velocity spread (between nulls) of the HI absorption is ~140 km s^-1, while that of both OH lines is ~100 km s^-1 the HI and OH spectra are broadly similar in that they each have two principal narrow components and a wide absorption trough. We argue that the wide absorption is likely to arise from source components in the Einstein ring and derive a rotation velocity of ~150 km s^-1 at a distance of 1.5 kpc from the centre of the z~ 0.6846 galaxy.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report the discovery of a quadruply imaged quasar, SDSS J125107.57+293540.5, selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Follow-up imaging reveals that the system consists of four blue pointlike components in a typical cusp lens geometry surrounding a central red galaxy. The source redshift is 0.802, and the lens redshift is 0.410. The maximum image separation between the lensed components is 1.79Prime. While the image configuration is well reproduced by standard mass models with reasonable parameter values, the flux ratios predicted by these models differ from the observed ratios in all bands. This is suggestive of small-scale structure in this lens, although a definitive identification of the anomaly requires more accurate photometry and astrometry.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report the discovery and confirmation of eight new two-image lensed quasars by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Quasar Lens Search. The lenses are SDSS J0904+1512 (image separation thetas = 1farcs13, source redshift z_s = 1.826), SDSS J1054+2733 (thetas = 1farcs27, z_s = 1.452), SDSS J1055+4628 (thetas = 1farcs15, z_s = 1.249), SDSS J1131+1915 (thetas = 1farcs46, z_s = 2.915), SDSS J1304+2001 (thetas = 1farcs87, z_s = 2.175), SDSS J1349+1227 (thetas = 3farcs00, z_s = 1.722), SDSS J1455+1447 (thetas = 1farcs73, z_s = 1.424), and SDSS J1620+1203 (thetas = 2farcs77, z_s = 1.158). Three of them, SDSS J1055+4628, SDSS J1455+1447, and SDSS J1620+1203, satisfy the criteria for constructing our statistical sample for studying the cosmological model. Based on galactic absorption lines of the lens galaxies, we also derive lens redshifts of z_l = 0.398 and z_l = 0.513 for SDSS J1620+1203 and the previously discovered lens SDSS J0746+4403, respectively.</abstract>

        <abstract>SDSS J092455.87+021924.9 is the most glaring example of a gravitational lens with anomalous flux ratios; optical broadband photometry shows image D to be a factor of 12 fainter than expected for smooth lens potentials. We report spectroscopy showing that the anomaly is present in the broad emission line flux ratios as well. There are differences between the emission-line and continuum flux ratios; the image A/image D ratio is 10 in the broad Lyalpha line and 19 in the associated continuum. Known variability argues for the presence of microlensing. We show that microlensing can account for both the continuum and emission-line flux ratios, if the broad emission line region is comparable in size to the Einstein radii of the microlenses. Specifically, we need the half-light radius of the broad-line region to be R_BLR&amp;lt;~0.4R_E~9 lt-days, which is small but reasonable. If the broad-line region is that large, then stars can contribute only 15\%-20\% of the surface mass density at the positions of the images. While we cannot exclude the possibility that millilensing by dark matter substructure is also present, we conclude that microlensing is present and sufficient to explain existing data. Under this hypothesis, the A/D flux ratio should return to a value close to unity on a timescale of years rather than millennia. Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by AURA, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.</abstract>

        <abstract>When the source in a four-image gravitational lens system lies sufficiently close to a ''fold" caustic, two of the lensed images lie very close together. If the lens potential is smooth on the scale of the separation between the two close images, the difference between their fluxes should approximately vanish, R_foldequiv(F_+-F_-)/(F_++F_-)~0. (The subscript indicates the image parity.) Violations of this ''fold relation" in observed lenses are thought to indicate the presence of structure on scales smaller than the separation between the close images. We present a detailed study of the fold relation in realistic smooth lenses, finding it to be more subtle and rich than was previously realized. The degree to which R_fold can differ from zero for smooth lenses depends not only on the distance of the source from the caustic, but also on its location along the caustic, and then on the angular structure of the lens potential (ellipticity, multipole modes, and external shear). Since the source position is unobservable, it is impossible to say from R_fold alone whether the flux ratios in an observed lens are anomalous or not. Instead, we must consider the full distribution of R_fold values that can be obtained from smooth lens potentials that reproduce the separation d_1 between the two close images and the distance d_2 to the next nearest image. (By reducing the image configuration to these two numbers, we limit our model dependence and obtain a generic analysis.) We show that the generic features of this distribution can be understood, which means that the fold relation provides a robust probe of small-scale structure in lens galaxies. We then compute the full distribution using Monte Carlo simulations of realistic smooth lenses. Comparing these predictions with the data, we find that five of the 12 known lenses with fold configurations have flux ratio anomalies: B0712+472, SDSS 0924+0219, PG 1115+080, B1555+375, and B1933+503. Combining this with our previous analysis revealing anomalies in three of the four known lenses with cusp configurations, we conclude that at least half (8/16) of all four-image lenses that admit generic, local analyses exhibit flux ratio anomalies. The fold and cusp relations do not reveal the nature of the implied small-scale structure, but do provide the formal foundation for substructure studies, and also indicate which lenses deserve further study. Although our focus is on close pairs of images, we show that the fold relation can be used-with great care-to analyze all image pairs in all 22 known four-image lenses and reveal lenses with some sort of interesting structure.</abstract>

        <abstract>We combine photometry and lens modeling to study the properties of 17 gravitational lens galaxies between z = 0.1 and ~1. Most of the lens galaxies are passively evolving early-type galaxies, with a few spirals. The colors, scale lengths, and ellipticities of lens galaxies are similar to those of the general population of early-type galaxies, although there may be a deficit of apparently round lens galaxies produced by the inclination dependence of lensing cross sections. The projected mass distributions are aligned with the projected light distributions to &amp;lt;~10 deg, except in the presence of a strong external tidal perturbation, suggesting that dark matter halos are significantly modified by interactions with the baryonic component and are not far out of alignment with the stars. Lens galaxies obey image separation/lens luminosity correlations analogous to the Faber-Jackson and Tully-Fisher relations, which are consistent with standard dark matter lens models. The lens galaxy mass-to-light ratios decrease with redshift as d(log M/L_B)/dz = -0.3 Â± 0.1 (-0.5 Â± 0.1) for Omega_0 = 1 (0.1), thus providing direct evidence of passive evolution for a sample of early-type galaxies in low-density environments. The evolution-corrected mass-to-light ratios are generally larger than predicted by constant M/L dynamical models, although there is significant scatter; with improved photometry, lens galaxy mass-to-light ratios would better distinguish between constant M/L and dark matter models. These conclusions are limited primarily by the quality of lens galaxy photometry.</abstract>

        <abstract>The strange morphology of the six-component gravitational lens PMN J0134-0931 has resisted explanation. We present the first successful quantitative models for the system, based on the idea that there are two lens galaxies and two components of the background source. One source is quintuply imaged and corresponds to the five brightest observed radio components. The other source is triply imaged and corresponds to the sixth component, along with two others too faint to have been detected. The models reproduce the observed image positions and fluxes and make falsifiable predictions about other properties of the system. Some of these predictions have been confirmed by high-resolution radio and optical observations, as described in the companion paper by Winn and coworkers. Although we cannot determine the lens model uniquely with current data, we predict that the lens galaxies are spiral galaxies with roughly equal velocity dispersions sigma~120 km s^-1 and a projected separation of only 0.4'' (2h^-1 kpc at z_l=0.76). This system is the first known lens with five images of a single quasar and the second with more than four images.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present polarization VLBI observations of the gravitational lens system B0218+357 at an observing frequency of 8.4 GHz. The lensed components A and B show a core-jet substructure at milliarcsecond (mas) resolution, consistent with the quantitative lensing properties known for the system. The identified core is linearly polarized at a level of 8%-12%. The polarization position angle difference between A and B is consistent with the expected behavior of polarized emission under gravitational lensing and the known rotation due to differential Faraday rotation along the two lines of sight through the lensing galaxy. The mas polarization structure confirms the expected parity reversal for the two lensed components predicted by generic lens models for this system. Indirect evidence is presented in support of the BL Lacertae optical classification of the lensed object.</abstract>

By matching radio spectra and polarization properties, we identify which components are likely to be gravitational images of the same part of the source. Using a simple lens model, we show that the image configuration is consistent with lensing by a galaxy, represented by a potential with a small ellipticity.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report the discovery, using NICMOS on the Hubble Space Telescope, of an arcsec-diameter Einstein ring in the gravitational lens system B1938 +666. The lensing galaxy is also detected, and is most likely an early-type galaxy. Modelling of the ring is presented and compared with the radio structure from MERLIN maps. We show that the Einstein ring is consistent with the gravitational lensing of an extended infrared component, centred between the two radio components.</abstract>

        <abstract>Most gravitational lenses are early-type galaxies in relatively low density environments-a ''field'' rather than a ''cluster'' population. Their average properties are the mass-averaged properties of all early-type galaxies. We show that field early-type galaxies with 0&amp;lt;z&amp;lt;1, as represented by the lens galaxies, lie on the same fundamental plane as those in rich clusters at similar redshifts. We then use the fundamental plane to measure the combined evolutionary and K-corrections for early-type galaxies in the V, I, and H bands. Only for passively evolving stellar populations formed at z_f&amp;gt;~2 (H_0=65 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, Omega_0=0.3, lambda_0=0.7) can the lens galaxies be matched to the local fundamental plane. The high formation epoch and the lack of significant differences between the field and cluster populations contradict many current models of the formation history of early-type galaxies. Lens galaxy colors and the fundamental plane provide good photometric redshift estimates with an empirical accuracy of &amp;lt;z_FP-z_l&amp;gt;=-0.04Â±0.09 for the 20 lenses with known redshifts. A mass model dominated by dark matter is more consistent with the data than either an isotropic or radially anisotropic constant M/L mass model, and a radially anisotropic model is better than an isotropic model.

        <abstract>We have obtained and modeled NICMOS images of the Einstein ring lens system MG J1131+0456, which show that its lens galaxy is an H=18.6 mag, transparent, early-type galaxy at a redshift of z_l~=0.84 it has a major axis effective radius R_e=0.7''Â±0.1'', projected axis ratio b/a=0.6Â±0.1, and major axis P.A.=55^degÂ±9^deg. The lens is the brightest member of a group of at least seven galaxies with similar R-I and I-H colors, and the two closest group members produce sufficient tidal perturbations to explain the shape of the ring. The host galaxy of the MG J1131+0456 source is a z_s&amp;gt;~2 extremely red object (ERO) that is lensed into optical and infrared rings of dramatically different morphologies. These differences imply a strongly wavelength-dependent source morphology that could be explained by embedding the host in a larger, dusty disk. At 1.6 mum (H), the ring is spectacularly luminous, with a total observed flux of H=17.4 mag and a demagnified flux of 19.3 mag, corresponding to a 1-2 L_* galaxy at the probable source redshift of z_s&amp;gt;~2. Thus, it is primarily the stellar emission of the radio source host galaxy that produces the overall colors of two of the reddest radio lenses, MG J1131+0456 and JVAS B1938+666, aided by the suppression of optical active galactic nucleus emission by dust in the source galaxy. The dusty lens hypothesis - that many massive early-type galaxies with 0&amp;lt;~z_l&amp;lt;~1 have large, uniform dust opacities - is ruled out.

        <abstract>The z = 1.377, B = 17.0 mag quasar SBS 0909+532 A, B is a double with two images separated by Delta theta = 1.''107 Â± 0.''006. Because the faint image has an emission line at the same wavelength as the Mg II 2798 Angstroms emission line of the quasar, and it lacks the broad Mg Ib absorption feature expected for a star with the same colors (a K star), we conclude that image B is a quasar with similar redshift to image A. The relative probabilities that the double is the smallest separation (4.7 h-1 kpc for Omega 0 = 1) correlated quasar pair or a gravitational lens are ~1:106. If the object is a lens, the mean lens redshift is &amp;lt;zl&amp;gt; = 0.5 with 90\% confidence bounds of 0.18 &amp;lt; zl &amp;lt; 0.83 for Omega 0 = 1. If the lens is an elliptical galaxy, we expect it to be brighter than I &amp;lt; 19.5 mag. The broadband flux ratio varies with wavelength, with Delta I = 0.31, Delta R = 0.58, and Delta B = 1.29 magnitudes, which is difficult to reconcile with the lensing hypothesis.</abstract>

        <abstract>We develop a new algorithm, LensClean, based on the Clean algorithm of radio astronomy, for consistently inverting partially or poorly resolved gravitational lens systems. The method is superior to previous algorithms, particularly when there is inadequate resolution in the observed image, and is significantly more effective at discriminating between good and bad lens models. We have applied LensClean to the 1.7 GHz Merlin and 8 GHz VLA maps of the radio ring lens PKS 1830-211. The quality of the inversions is largely limited by systematic errors in the radio maps, primarily the varying flux ratio of the two compact components. We estimate that the critical radius of the lens in PKS 1830-211 is 0.51 arcsec, the dimensionless ellipticity is 0.050, and the position angle of the major axis of the lens potential is -2 deg.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report the discovery of two strongly lensed z ~ 3 Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) discovered as u-band dropouts as part of the SDSS Giant Arcs Survey (SGAS). The first, SGAS J122651.3+215220 at z = 2.9233, is lensed by one of several sub-clusters, SDSS J1226+2152, in a complex massive cluster at z = 0.43. Its (g, r, i) magnitudes are (21.14, 20.60, 20.51) which translate to surface brightnesses, mu_ g,r,i , of (23.78, 23.11, 22.81). The second, SGAS J152745.1+065219, is an LBG at z = 2.7593 lensed by the foreground SDSS J1527+0652 at z = 0.39, with (g, r, z) = (20.90, 20.52, 20.58) and mu_ g,r,z  = (25.15, 24.52, 24.12). Moderate resolution spectroscopy confirms the redshifts suggested by photometric breaks and shows both absorption and emission features typical of LBGs. Lens mass models derived from combined imaging and spectroscopy reveal that SGAS J122651.3+215220 is a highly magnified source (M ~= 40), while SGAS J152745.1+065219 is magnified by no more than M ~= 15. Compared with LBG survey results, the luminosities and lensing-corrected magnitudes suggest that SGAS J122651.3+215220 is among the faintest sime20\% of LBGs in that sample. SGAS J152745.1+065219, on the other hand, has an unlensed r-band apparent magnitude similar to that of the ''Cosmic Eye,'' which places it near the mean of LBG survey results over similar redshifts.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present flux ratio curves of the fold and cusp (i.e., close multiple) images of six Jodrell Bank VLA Astrometric Survey and Cosmic Lens All-Sky Survey (JVAS/CLASS) gravitational lens systems. The data were obtained over a period of 8.5 months in 2001 with the Multi Element Radio-Linked Interferometer Network (MERLIN) at 5 GHz with 50 mas resolution, as part of a MERLIN Key Project. Even though the time delays between the fold and cusp images are small (&amp;lt;~1 day) compared to the timescale of intrinsic source variability, all six lens systems show evidence that suggests the presence of extrinsic variability. In particular, the cusp images of B2045+265-regarded as the strongest case of the violation of the cusp relation (i.e., the sum of the magnifications of the three cusp images add to zero)-show extrinsic variations in their flux ratios up to ~40\% peak to peak on timescales of several months. Its low Galactic latitude of b~-10^deg and a line of sight toward the Cygnus superbubble region suggest that Galactic scintillation is the most likely cause. The cusp images of B1422+231 at b~+69^deg do not show strong extrinsic variability. Galactic scintillation can therefore cause significant scatter in the cusp and fold relations of some radio lens systems (up to 10\% rms), even though these relations remain violated when averaged over a &amp;lt;~1 yr time baseline.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present the discovery of a new gravitational lens system with two compact radio images separated by 0.701 Â± 0.001 arcsec. The lens system was discovered in the Cosmic Lens All Sky Survey (CLASS) as a flat-spectrum radio source. Both radio components show structure in a Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) 8.4-GHz radio image. No further extended structure is seen in Very Large Array (VLA), Multi-Element Radio Linked Interferometer Network (MERLIN) or VLBA images. Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFPC2 images in F555W and F814W show two extended objects close to the radio components, which we identify as two lens galaxies. Their colours and mass-to-light ratios seem to favour two late-type spiral galaxies at relatively high redshifts (z_d&amp;gt;=0.5). Faint emission is also detected at positions corresponding to the radio images. A two-lens mass model can explain the observed VLBA structure. The best-fitting model has a reduced chi^2 of 1.1. The relative positions of the VLBA subcomponents are reproduced within 0.08 mas, and the flux density ratios within 20 per cent. We also reproduce the position angle and separation of the two VLBA subcomponents in A and B within the observational errors, which we consider strong evidence for the validity of the lens model. Moreover, we find a surface density axis ratio of 0.74^+0.10_-0.12 for the primary lens (G1), consistent with the surface brightness axis ratio of 0.69Â±0.15. Also, the surface density position angle of (4.9^+28.2_-22.4) of G1 compares well with the (-6Â±13) position angle of the surface brightness distribution. The errors indicate the 99 per cent confidence interval.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present Very Large Array (VLA) 8.5-GHz light curves of the two lens images of the Cosmic Lens All Sky Survey (CLASS) gravitational lens B1600+434. We find a nearly linear decrease of 18-19\% in the flux densities of both lens images over a period of eight months (February-October) in 1998. Additionally, the brightest image A shows modulations up to 11\% peak-to-peak on scales of days to weeks over a large part of the observing period. Image B varies significantly less on this time scale. We conclude that most of the short-term variability in image A is not intrinsic source variability, but is most likely caused by microlensing in the lens galaxy. The alternative, scintillation by the ionized Galactic ISM, is shown to be implausible based on its strong opposite frequency dependent behavior compared with results from multi-frequency WSRT monitoring observations (Koopmans &amp; de Bruyn 1999). From these VLA light curves we determine a median time delay between the lens images of 47^+5_-6 d (68\%) or 47^+12_-9 d (95\%). We use two different methods to derive the time delay; both give the same result within the errors. We estimate an additional systematic error between -8 and +7 d. If the mass distribution of lens galaxy can be described by an isothermal model (Koopmans, de Bruyn &amp; Jackson 1998), this time delay would give a value for the Hubble parameter, H\_0=57^+14_-11 (95\% statistical) ^+26_-15 (systematic) km s^-1 Mpc^-1 (Omega\_m =1 and Omega_Lambda =0). Similarly, the Modified-Hubble-Profile mass model would give H\_0=74^+18_-15 (95\% statistical) ^+22_-22 (systematic) km s^-1 Mpc^-1. For Omega\_m =0.3 and Omega_Lambda =0.7, these values increase by 5.4\%. We emphasize that the slope of the radial mass profile of the lens-galaxy dark-matter halo in B1600+434 is extremely ill-constrained. Hence, an accurate determination of H\_0 from this system is very difficult, if no additional constraints on the mass model are obtained. These values of H\_0 should therefore be regarded as indicative. Once H\_0 (from independent methods) and the time delay have been determined with sufficient accuracy, it will prove more worthwhile to constrain the radial mass profile of the dark-matter halo around the edge-on spiral lens galaxy at z=0.4.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present mass models of the four-image gravitational lens system B1608+656, based on information obtained through VLBA imaging, VLA monitoring, and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFPC2 and NICMOS imaging. We have determined a mass model for the lens galaxies that reproduces (1) all image positions within the observational errors, (2) two out of three flux-density ratios within about 10% from the observed ratios, and (3) the model time delays within 1% from their observed values, given our best estimate of the Hubble parameter. Using the time delays determined in a companion paper, we also find that the best isothermal mass model gives H_0=59^+7_-6 km s^-1 Mpc^-1 for Omega_m=1 and Omega_Lambda=0.0, or H_0=(65-63)^+7_-6 km s^-1 Mpc^-1 for Omega_m=0.3 and Omega_Lambda=0.0-0.7. The statistical errors indicate the 95.4% (2 sigma) confidence interval. A systematic error of Â±15 km s^-1 Mpc^-1 is estimated from a 20% (1 sigma) uncertainty in the steepness of radial mass profile. This cosmological determination of H_0 agrees well with determinations from three other gravitational lens systems (i.e., B0218+357, Q0957+561, and PKS 1830-211), Type Ia supernovae, the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect and local determinations. The current agreement on H_0-within the 1 sigma statistical errors-from four of five gravitational lens systems (1) emphasizes the reliability of its determination from isolated gravitational lens systems and (2) suggests that a close-to-isothermal mass profile can describe disk galaxies (e.g., B0218+357 and possibly PKS 1830-211), ellipticals (e.g., B1608+656), and central cluster ellipticals (e.g., Q0957+561). The average of H_0 from B0218+357, Q0957+561, B1608+656, and PKS 1830-211, gives H^GL_0=69Â±7 km s^-1 Mpc^-1 for a flat universe with Omega_m=1 or H^GL_0=74Â±8 km s^-1 Mpc^-1 for Omega_m=0.3 and Omega_Lambda=0.0-0.7. When including PG 1115+080, these values decrease to 64Â±11 km s^-1 Mpc^-1 and 68Â±13 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, respectively. The errors are the estimated 2 sigma errors on the average. The Hubble parameter from gravitational lenses seems to agree best with local determinations of H_0 for a low-density universe, under the assumption that all lenses are nearly isothermal.</abstract>

        <abstract>We have measured the kinematic profile of the early-type (E/S0) lens galaxy in the system 0047-281 (z=0.485) with the Echelle Spectrograph and Imager (ESI) on the W. M. Keck II Telescope, as part of the Lenses Structure and Dynamics (LSD) Survey. The central velocity dispersion is sigma=229Â±15 km s^-1, and the dispersion profile is nearly flat to beyond one effective radius (R_e). No significant streaming motion is found. Surface photometry of the lens galaxy is measured from Hubble Space Telescope images. From the offset from the local fundamental plane (FP), we measure an evolution of the effective mass-to-light ratio (M/L) of Deltalog(M/L_B)=-0.37Â±0.06 between z=0 and 0.485, consistent with the observed evolution of field E/S0 galaxies. (We assume h_65=1, Omega_m=0.3, and Omega_Lambda=0.7 throughout.) Gravitational lens models provide a mass of M_E=(4.06Â±0.20)\times10^11h^- 1_65 M_solar inside the Einstein radius of R_E=(8.70Â±0.07)h^-1_65 kpc. This allows us to break the degeneracy between velocity anisotropy and density profile typical of dynamical models for E/S0 galaxies. We find that constant-M/L models, even with strongly tangential anisotropy of the stellar velocity ellipsoid, are excluded at more than 99.9\% CL. The total mass distribution inside R_E can be described by a single power-law density profile, rho_t~r^-gamma&lt;SUP&gt;'&lt;/SUP&gt;, with an effective slope gamma^'=1.90^+0.05_-0.23 (68\% CL; Â±0.1 systematic error). Two-component models yield an upper limit (68\% CL) of gamma&amp;lt;=1.55(1.12) on the power-law slope of the dark matter density profile and a projected dark matter mass fraction of 0.41(0.54)^+0.15_-0.05(^+0.09_- 0.06) (68\% CL) inside R_E, for Osipkov-Merritt models with anisotropy radius r_i=\infin(R_e). The stellar M_*/L values derived from the FP agree well with the maximum allowed value from the isotropic dynamical models (i.e., the ''maximum-bulge solution''). The fact that both lens systems 0047-281 (z=0.485) and MG 2016+112 (z=1.004) are well described inside their Einstein radii by a constant-M_*/L stellar mass distribution embedded in a nearly logarithmic potential-with an isotropic or a mildly radially anisotropic dispersion tensor-could indicate that E/S0 galaxies underwent little structural evolution at z&amp;lt;~1 and have a close-to-isothermal total mass distribution in their inner regions. Whether this conclusion can be generalized, however, requires the analysis of more systems. We briefly discuss our results in the context of E/S0 galaxy formation and cold dark matter simulations. Based on observations collected at W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated jointly by the California Institute of Technology and the University of California, and with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at STScI, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present a joint gravitational lensing and stellar-dynamical analysis of 15 massive field early-type galaxies selected from the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) Survey. The following numerical results are found: (1) A joint likelihood gives an average logarithmic density slope for the total mass density of &amp;lt;gamma^'&amp;gt;=2.01^+0.02_-0.03 (68\% CL; rho_tot~r^-gamma&lt;SUP&gt;'&lt;/SUP&gt;) inside &amp;lt;R_Einst&amp;gt;=4.2Â±0.4 kpc (rms of 1.6 kpc) for isotropic models. The inferred intrinsic rms spread in logarithmic density slopes is sigma_gamma&lt;SUP&gt;'&lt;/SUP&gt;=0.12. (2) The average position-angle difference between the light distribution and the total mass distribution is found to be &amp;lt;Deltathetas&amp;gt;=0^degÂ±3^deg (rms of 10&amp;deg;), setting an upper limit of &amp;lt;gamma_ext&amp;gt;&amp;lt;~0.035 on the average external shear. The total mass has an average ellipticity &amp;lt;q_SIE&amp;gt;=0.78Â±0.03 (rms of 0.12), which correlates extremely well with the stellar ellipticity, q_*, resulting in &amp;lt;q_SIE/q_*&amp;gt;=0.99Â±0.03 (rms of 0.11) for sigma&amp;gt;~225 km s^-1 omitting three S0 lens galaxies. (3) The average projected dark matter mass fraction is inferred to be &amp;lt;f_DM&amp;gt;=0.25Â±0.06 (rms of 0.22) inside &amp;lt;R_Einst&amp;gt;, using the stellar mass-to-light ratios derived from the fundamental plane as priors. (4) Combined with results from the Lenses Structure and Dynamics (LSD) Survey at z&amp;gt;~0.3, we find no significant evolution of the total density slope inside one effective radius for galaxies with sigma_ap&amp;gt;=200 km s^-1: a linear fit gives alpha_gamma&lt;SUP&gt;'&lt;/SUP&gt;equivd&amp;lt;gamma^'&amp;gt;/dz=0.23Â±0.16 (1 sigma) for the range z=0.08-1.01. The small scatter and absence of significant evolution in the inner density slopes suggest a collisional scenario in which gas and dark matter strongly couple during galaxy formation, leading to a total mass distribution that rapidly converges to dynamical isothermality.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present a refined gravitational lens model of the four-image lens system B1608+656 based on new and improved observational constraints: (1) the three independent time delays and flux ratios from Very Large Array observations, (2) the radio-image positions from Very Large Baseline Array observations, (3) the shape of the deconvolved Einstein ring from optical and infrared Hubble Space Telescope images, (4) the extinction-corrected lens-galaxy centroids and structural parameters, and (5) a stellar velocity dispersion, sigma_ap=247Â±35 km s^-1, of the primary lens galaxy (G1), obtained from an echelle spectrum taken with the Keck II Telescope. The lens-mass model consists of two elliptical mass distributions with power-law density profiles and an external shear, totaling 22 free parameters, including the density slopes that are the key parameters for determining the value of H_0 from lens time delays. This has required the development of a new lens code that is highly optimized for speed. The minimum-chi^2 model reproduces all observations very well, including the stellar velocity dispersion and the shape of the Einstein ring. A combined gravitational lens and stellar dynamical analysis leads to a value of the Hubble constant of H_0=75^+7_-6 km s^- 1 Mpc^ -1 (68% CL; Omega_m=0.3, Omega_Lambda=0.7). The nonlinear error analysis includes correlations between all free parameters, in particular the density slopes of G1 and G2, yielding an accurate determination of the random error on H_0. The lens galaxy G1 is ~5 times more massive than the secondary lens galaxy (G2) and has a mass density slope of gamma^'_G1=2.03^+0.14_-0.14Â±0.03 (68% CL) for rho~r^-gamma&lt;SUP&gt;'&lt;/SUP&gt;, very close to isothermal (gamma^'=2). After extinction correction, G1 exhibits a smooth surface brightness distribution with an R^1/4 profile and no apparent evidence for tidal disruption by interactions with G2. Given the scope of the observational constraints and the gravitational lens models, as well as the careful corrections to the data, we believe this value of H_0 to be little affected by known systematic errors (&amp;lt;~5%).

        <abstract>Using a high-resolution radio image, we successfully resolve the two-fold image components B and C of the quasar lens system SDSS J1029+2623. The flux anomalies associated with these two components in the optical regime persist, albeit less strongly, in our radio observations suggesting that the cluster must be modeled by something more than a single central potential. We argue that placing substructure close to one of the components can account for a flux anomaly with negligible changes in the component positions. Our best-fit model has a substructure mass of ~10^9 M _sun up to the mass-sheet degeneracy, located roughly 0farcs1 west and 0farcs1 north of component B. We demonstrate that a positional offset between the centers of the source components can explain the differences between the optical and radio flux ratios.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present new results of our program to systematically search for strongly lensed galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) imaging data. In this study six strong lens systems are presented which we have confirmed with follow-up spectroscopy and imaging using the 3.5 m telescope at the Apache Point Observatory. Preliminary mass models indicate that the lenses are group-scale systems with velocity dispersions ranging from 464 to 882 km s^-1 at z = 0.17 - 0.45 which are strongly lensing source galaxies at z = 0.4 - 1.4. Galaxy groups are a relatively new mass scale just beginning to be probed with strong lensing. Our sample of lenses roughly doubles the confirmed number of group-scale lenses in the SDSS and complements ongoing strong lens searches in other imaging surveys. As our arcs were discovered in the SDSS imaging data they are all bright (r lsim 22), making them ideally suited for detailed follow-up studies.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report the discovery of seven new, very bright gravitational lens systems from our ongoing gravitational lens search, the Sloan Bright Arcs Survey (SBAS). Two of the systems are confirmed to have high source redshifts z = 2.19 and z = 2.94. Three other systems lie at intermediate redshift with z = 1.33, 1.82, 1.93 and two systems are at low redshift z = 0.66, 0.86. The lensed source galaxies in all of these systems are bright, with i-band magnitudes ranging from 19.73 to 22.06. We present the spectrum of each of the source galaxies in these systems along with estimates of the Einstein radius for each system. The foreground lens in most systems is identified by a red sequence based cluster finder as a galaxy group; one system is identified as a moderately rich cluster. In total, SBAS has now discovered 19 strong lens systems in the SDSS imaging data, 8 of which are among the highest surface brightness z \~= 2-3 galaxies known.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report the discovery of a z=2.65 low-ionization iron broad absorption line quasar, FIRST J100424.9+122922, which is gravitationally lensed by a galaxy at z~0.95. The object was discovered as part of a program to find very red quasars by matching the FIRST radio survey with the Two Micron All Sky Survey in the near-infrared. J100424.9+122922 is the second lensed system to be found in this program, suggesting that many gravitational lenses are probably missed from conventional optical quasar surveys. We have made a simple lens model and a rough estimate of the reddening in the immediate environment of the quasar which suggests that the quasar is intrinsically very luminous and is accreting at close to the Eddington limit of its ~10^9 M_solar black hole. The lensing galaxy has a small amount of dust, which is responsible for some excess reddening observed in the fainter image of the quasar, but is otherwise a fairly typical massive elliptical galaxy. We model the selection effects working against the detection of red quasars in both lensed and unlensed samples. We show that these selection effects are very effective at removing even lightly reddened high-redshift quasars from magnitude-limited samples, whether they are lensed or not. This suggests that the red quasar population in general could be very large, and in particular the class of iron broad absorption line quasars of which J100424.9+122922 is a member may be much larger than their rarity in magnitude-limited samples would suggest.</abstract>

        <abstract>We use high-resolution adaptive optics (AO) imaging on the Keck II telescope to study the gravitational lens B0128+437 in unprecedented detail, allowing us to resolve individual lensed quasar components and, for the first time, detect and measure properties of the lensing galaxy. B0128+437 is a small-separation lens with known flux-ratio and astrometric anomalies. We discuss possible causes for these anomalies, including the presence of substructure in the lensing galaxy, propagation effects due to dust and a turbulent interstellar medium, and gravitational microlensing. This work demonstrates that AO will be an essential tool for studying the many new small-separation lenses expected from future surveys.</abstract>

        <abstract>We measure the average mass properties of a sample of 41 strong gravitational lenses at moderate redshift (z ~ 0.4 - 0.9), and present the lens redshift for 6 of these galaxies for the first time. Using the techniques of strong and weak gravitational lensing on archival data obtained from the Hubble Space Telescope, we determine that the average mass overdensity profile of the lenses can be fit with a power-law profile (Delta_Sigma prop. to R^-0.86 Â± 0.16) that is within 1-sigma of an isothermal profile (Delta_Sigma prop. to R^-1) with velocity dispersion sigma_v = 260 Â± 20 km/s. Additionally, we use a two-component de Vaucouleurs+NFW model to disentangle the total mass profile into separate luminous and dark matter components, and determine the relative fraction of each component. We measure the average rest frame V-band stellar mass-to-light ratio (Upsilon_V = 4.0 Â± 0.6 h M_sol/L_sol) and virial mass-to-light ratio (tau_V = 300 Â± 90 h M_sol/L_sol) for our sample, resulting in a virial-to-stellar mass ratio of M_vir/M_* = 75 Â± 25. Finally, we compare our results to a previous study using low redshift lenses, to understand how galaxy mass profiles evolve over time. We investigate the evolution of M_vir/M_*(z) = alpha(1+z)^beta, and find best fit parameters of alpha = 51 Â± 36 and beta = 0.9 Â± 1.8, constraining the growth of virial to stellar mass ratio over the last ~7 Gigayears. We note that, by using a sample of strong lenses, we are able to constrain the growth of M_vir/M_*(z) without making any assumptions about the IMF of the stellar population.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present simultaneous XMM-Newton UV and X-ray observations of the quadruply lensed quasar &lt;ASTROBJ&gt;SDSS J1004+4112&lt;/ASTROBJ&gt; (&lt;ASTROBJ&gt;RBS 825&lt;/ASTROBJ&gt;). Simultaneously with the XMM-Newton observations we also performed integral field spectroscopy on the two closest lens images A and B using the Calar Alto PMAS spectrograph. In X-rays the widely spaced components C and D are clearly resolved, while the closer pair of images A and B is marginally resolved in the XMM-EPIC images. The integrated X-ray flux of the system has decreased by a factor of 6 since it was observed in the ROSAT All Sky Survey in 1990, while the X-ray spectrum became much harder with the power law index evolving from Gamma=-2.3 to Gamma=-1.86. By deblending the X-ray images of the lensed QSO we find that the X-ray flux ratios between the lens images A and B are significantly different from the simultaneously obtained UV ratios and previously measured optical flux ratios. Our optical spectrum of lens image A shows an enhancement in the blue emission line wings, which has been observed in previous epochs as a transient feature. We propose a scenario where intrinsic UV and X-ray variability gives rise to line variations which are selectively magnified in image A by microlensing. The extended emission of the lensing cluster of galaxies is clearly detected in the EPIC images, we measure a 0.5-2.0 keV luminosity of 1.4 	imes 10^44~erg/s.

        <abstract>VLA radio images of MG 1654+1346, a candidate for an Einstein Ring gravitational lens, reveal two components which are separated by about 7 arcsec. Two optical counterparts, a 19-mag galaxy coincident with the center of the radio ring and a blue 21-mag stellar object located about 3 arcsec northeast of the galaxy, are identified. A model representing the source as a quasar with two extended radio lobes and the lens as an elliptical potential at the position of the galaxy is found to reasonably reproduce the radio observations.</abstract>

A catalogue of 1,683 objects is presented, with estimated redshifts ranging from z = 0 to z &amp;gt; 6.

        <abstract>A new gravitational lens system, the triple radio source MG2016+112, has been discovered. Five emission lines at a redshift of 3.2733 Â± 0.0014 have been identified in the spectra of two stellar objects of magnitude 22.5 coincident with radio components 3.4 arc seconds apart. The lines are the narrowest ever observed in objects at such a large redshift. The redshift of a 23rd-magnitude extended optical object coincident with the third radio component has not been determined spectroscopically, but its known optical properties are consistent with those of a giant elliptical galaxy with a redshift of about 0.8.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report on a program to obtain Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of galaxy-mass gravitational lens systems at optical and infrared wavelengths. Here we discuss the properties of 10 two-image gravitational lens systems (Q0142-100=UM 673, B0218+357, SBS 0909+532, BRI 0952-0115, LBQS 1009-0252, Q1017-207=J03.13, B1030+074, HE 1104-1805, Q1208+1011, and PKS 1830-211). We grouped these 10 systems because they have limited lens model constraints and often show poor contrast between the images and the lens galaxy. Of the 10 lens galaxies, seven are probably early-type galaxies, two are probably late-type galaxies (B0218+357 and PKS 1830-211), and one was not detected (Q1208+1011). We detect the host galaxies of the z_s=4.50 lensed quasar in BRI 0952-0115, the z_s=2.32 lensed quasar in HE 1104-1805, and the unlensed z=1.63 quasar near LBQS 1009-0252. We fit a set of four standard lens models to each lens that had sufficient constraints to compare isothermal dark matter and constant mass-to-light lens models, and to explore the effects of local tidal shears. Based on Observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by AURA, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report the discovery of a new gravitationally lensed radio source. Radio maps of MG0751+2716 show four lensed images, which, at higher resolution, are resolved into long arcs of emission. A group of galaxies is present in optical images, including the principal lensing galaxy, with a much brighter galaxy just a few arcseconds away. We have measured the redshift of this brighter galaxy. No optical counterpart to the background source has been detected. Lens models that can readily reproduce the lensed image positions all require a substantial shear component. However, neither the very elongated lens nor the bright nearby galaxy are correctly positioned to explain the shear. Lens models which associate the mass with the light of galaxies in the group can produce an acceptable fit, but only with an extreme mass-to-light ratio in one of the minor group members.</abstract>

        <abstract>We have measured a velocity dispersion for the foreground galaxy in this gravitationally lensed system. Our dispersion confirms the prediction from lens models, provided that the source is distant enough (z\_S\_ &amp;gt; 0.2). Current interpretations of lensing statistics depend sensitively on how the optical and mass dispersions are related. For z\_S\_ &amp;gt; 0.5, our observations favor sigma\_mass\_/sigma\_opt\_ ~ 1, but our uncertainties prevent us from clearly distinguishing between dynamical models. We could not obtain a unique mass profile from lensing constraints, but models with a constant mass-to-light ratio are possible. We also found unusual rotation in the lensing galaxy, and confirmed its redshift.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report the discovery of a new gravitational lens in the radio source MG 1549 + 3047. The source has a compact core and two lobes, with a faint optical counterpart to the core. The brighter lobe is shaped like a ring, and centered on a foreground galaxy with known redshift. The radio structure of the ring can be reproduced by distorting a typical radio lobe through a simple elliptical gravitational lensing potential, which models the mass distribution in the foreground galaxy. From a preliminary lens model, we show that the mass distribution follows the observed luminosity, and we predict a central velocity dispersion of about 230 km/sec. This corresponds to a blue mass-to-light ratio of about 18h solar units. The lens appears to be an ordinary elliptical galaxy, and the many multiply-imaged structures make MG 1549 + 3047 well-suited to directly determine its mass distribution.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report the discovery of a new four-image gravitational lens in the radio source MG0751+2716. Gravitational lensing occurs when the light from a distant source is deflected by the mass of an intervening lens. Since the gravitational deflection traces the total mass of the lens, gravitational lenses can be used to probe the dark matter distribution in galaxies. This approach can provide an important confirmation of dynamical mass profile determinations, and the lensing galaxies are typically at very great distances (z ~ 1). MG0751+2716 was discovered as part of the MIT-Greenbank-VLA search for gravitational lenses (Hewitt 1986, Conner 1993, MIT Ph.D. theses), and consists of four compact radio components. High resolution MERLIN maps show an unresolved arc extending between the two brightest images. We present radio and optical observations of this system, and preliminary models of the lensing mass.</abstract>

        <abstract>We carry out a comprehensive joint analysis of high-quality HST/ACS and Chandra measurements of A1689, from which we derive mass, temperature, X-ray emission and abundance profiles. The X-ray emission is smooth and symmetric, and the lensing mass is centrally concentrated indicating a relaxed cluster. Assuming hydrostatic equilibrium we deduce a 3D mass profile that agrees simultaneously with both the lensing and X-ray measurements. However, the projected temperature profile predicted with this 3D mass profile exceeds the observed temperature by \~30 per cent at all radii, a level of discrepancy comparable to the level found for other relaxed clusters. This result may support recent suggestions from hydrodynamical simulations that denser, more X-ray luminous small-scale structure can bias observed temperature measurements downward at about the same (\~30 per cent) level. We determine the gas entropy at 0.1r_vir (where r_vir is the virial radius) to be \~800 keV cm^2, as expected for a high-temperature cluster, but its profile at \&amp;gt;0.1r_vir has a power-law form with index \~0.8, considerably shallower than the \~1.1 index advocated by theoretical studies and simulations. Moreover, if a constant entropy 'floor' exists at all, then it is within a small region in the inner core, r \&amp;lt; 0.02r_vir, in accord with previous theoretical studies of massive clusters.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present high-resolution imaging of the low-order (J = 1 and 2) CO line emission from the z = 3.93 submillimeter galaxy (SMG) MM18423+5938 using the Expanded Very Large Array, and optical and near-IR imaging using the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. This SMG with a spectroscopic redshift was thought to be gravitationally lensed given its enormous apparent brightness. We find that the CO emission is consistent with a complete Einstein ring with a major axis diameter of ~1farcs4, indicative of lensing. We have also identified the lensing galaxy as a very red elliptical coincident with the geometric center of the ring and estimated its photometric redshift z ~ 1.1. A first estimate of the lens magnification factor is m ~ 12. The luminosity L'_CO(1 - 0) of the CO(1-0) emission is 2.71 Â± 0.38 \times 10^11 m ^-1 K km s^-1 pc^2, and, adopting the commonly used conversion factor for ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs), the molecular gas mass is M(H_2) = 2.2 \times 10^11 m ^-1 M _sun, comparable to unlensed SMGs if corrected by m ~ 12. Our revised estimate of the far-IR luminosity of MM18423+5938 is 2 \times 10^13 m ^-1 &amp;lt; L _FIR &amp;lt; 3 \times 10^14 m ^-1 L _sun, comparable to that of ULIRGs. Further observations are required to quantify the star formation rate in MM18423+5938 and to constrain the mass model of the lens in more detail.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present a non-parametric technique to infer the projected mass distribution of a gravitational lens system with multiple strong-lensed images. The technique involves a dynamic grid in the lens plane on which the mass distribution of the lens is approximated by a sum of basis functions, one per grid cell. We used the projected mass densities of Plummer spheres as basis functions. A genetic algorithm then determines the mass distribution of the lens by forcing images of a single source, projected back on to the source plane, to coincide as well as possible. Averaging several tens of solutions removes the random fluctuations that are introduced by the reproduction process of genomes in the genetic algorithm and highlights those features common to all solutions. Given the positions of the images and the redshifts of the sources and the lens, we show that the mass of a gravitational lens can be retrieved with an accuracy of a few percent and that, if the sources sufficiently cover the caustics, the mass distribution of the gravitational lens can also be reliably retrieved. A major advantage of the algorithm is that it makes full use of the information contained in the radial images, unlike methods that minimize the residuals of the lens equation, and is thus able to accurately reconstruct also the inner parts of the lens.</abstract>

        <abstract>The cluster lens Cl 0024+1654 is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful examples of strong gravitational lensing, providing five large images of a single source with well-resolved substructure. Using the information contained in the positions and the shapes of the images, combined with the null space information, a non-parametric technique is used to infer the strong lensing mass map of the central region of this cluster. This yields a strong lensing mass of 1.60 x 10^14M_solar within a 0.5arcmin radius around the cluster centre. This mass distribution is then used as a case study of the monopole degeneracy, which may be one of the most important degeneracies in gravitational lensing studies and which is extremely hard to break. We illustrate the monopole degeneracy by adding circularly symmetric density distributions with zero total mass to the original mass map of Cl 0024+1654. These redistribute mass in certain areas of the mass map without affecting the observed images in any way. We show that the monopole degeneracy and the mass-sheet degeneracy together lie at the heart of the discrepancies between different gravitational lens reconstructions that can be found in the literature for a given object, and that many images/sources, with an overall high image density in the lens plane, are required to construct an accurate, high-resolution mass map based on strong lensing data.</abstract>

        <abstract>In this article, we study the well-known strong lensing system SDSS J1004+4112. Not only does it host a large-separation lensed quasar with measured time-delay information, but several other lensed galaxies have been identified as well. A previously developed strong lens inversion procedure that is designed to handle a wide variety of constraints is applied to this lensing system and compared to results reported in other works. Without the inclusion of a tentative central image of one of the galaxies as a constraint, we find that the model recovered by the other constraints indeed predicts an image at that location. An inversion which includes the central image provides tighter constraints on the shape of the central part of the mass map. The resulting model also predicts a central image of a second galaxy where indeed an object is visible in the available Advanced Camera for Surveys images. We find masses of 2.5 x 10^13 and 6.1 x 10^13M_solar within a radius of 60 and 110 kpc, respectively, confirming the results from other authors. The resulting mass map is compatible with an elliptical generalization of a projected NFW profile, with r_s = 58^+21_-13 arcsec and c_vir = 3.91 Â± 0.74. The orientation of the elliptical NFW profile closely follows the orientation of the central cluster galaxy and the overall distribution of cluster members.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present results of a strong-lensing analysis of MACS J0717.5+3745 (hereafter MACS J0717), an extremely X-ray luminous galaxy cluster at z = 0.55. Observations at different wavelengths reveal a complex and dynamically very active cluster, whose core is connected to a large scale filament extended over several Mpc. Using multi-passband imaging data obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS), we identify 15 multiply imaged systems across the full field of view of ACS, five of which we confirmed spectroscopically in ground-based follow-up observations with the Keck telescope. We use these multiply imaged systems to constrain a parametric model of the mass distribution in the cluster core, employing a new parallelized version of the Lenstool software. The main result is that the most probable description of the mass distribution comprises four cluster-scale dark matter haloes. The total mass distribution follows the light distribution but strongly deviates from the distribution of the intra-cluster gas as traced by the X-ray surface brightness. This confirms the complex morphology proposed by previous studies. We interpret this segregation of collisional and collisionless matter as strong evidence of multiple mergers and ongoing dynamical activity. MACS J0717 thus constitutes one of the most disturbed clusters presently known and, featuring a projected mass within the ACS field of view (R = 150\Prime = 960 kpc) of 2.11 Â± 0.23 \times 10^15 M_â, the system is also one of the most massive known. Based on observations obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the Keck Telescope.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present a reconstruction of the mass distribution of galaxy cluster Abell 1689 at z=0.18 using detected strong lensing features from deep ACS observations and extensive ground based spectroscopy. Earlier analyses have reported up to 32 multiply imaged systems in this cluster, of which only 3 were spectroscopically confirmed. In this work, we present a parametric strong lensing mass reconstruction using 34 multiply imaged systems of which 24 have newly determined spectroscopic redshifts, which is a major step forward in building a robust mass model. In turn, the new spectroscopic data allows a more secure identification of multiply imaged systems. The resultant mass model enables us to reliably predict the redshifts of additional multiply imaged systems for which no spectra are currently available, and to use the location of these systems to further constrain the mass model. Using our strong lensing mass model, we predict on larger scale a shear signal which is consistent with that inferred from our large scale weak lensing analysis derived using CFH12K wide field images. Thanks to a new method for reliably selecting a well defined background lensed galaxy population, we resolve the discrepancy found between the NFW concentration parameters derived from earlier strong and weak lensing analysis. The derived parameters for the best fit NFW profile is found to be c_200=7.6Â±1.6 and r_200=2.16Â±0.10 h^-1_70 Mpc (corresponding to a 3D mass equal to M_200=[1.32Â±0.2]\\\\times10^15 h_70 M_solar). The large number of new constraints incorporated in this work makes Abell 1689 the most reliably reconstructed cluster to date. This well calibrated mass model, which we here make publicly available, will enable us to exploit Abell 1689 efficiently as a gravitational telescope, as well as to potentially constrain cosmology. Based on observations obtained at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), which is operated by the National Research Council of Canada, the Institut National des Sciences de l'Univers of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique of France, and the University of Hawaii. Also based on observations from the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope (programs 9289 and 10150) obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by AURA under NASA contract NAS5-26555.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report on the discovery of a very bright z = 2.00 star-forming galaxy that is strongly lensed by a foreground z = 0.422 luminous red galaxy (LRG), SDSS J120602.09+514229.5. This system, nicknamed the ''Clone,'' was found in a systematic search for bright arcs lensed by LRGs and brightest cluster galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 5 sample. Follow-up observations on the Subaru 8.2 m telescope on Mauna Kea and the Astrophysical Research Consortium 3.5 m telescope at Apache Point Observatory confirmed the lensing nature of this system. A simple lens model for the system, assuming a singular isothermal ellipsoid mass distribution, yields an Einstein radius of thetas_Ein = 3.82 Â± 0farcs03 or 14.8 Â± 0.1 h ^-1 kpc at the lens redshift. The total projected mass enclosed within the Einstein radius is 2.10 Â± 0.03 \\times 10^12 h ^-1 M _sun, and the magnification factor for the source galaxy is 27 Â± 1. Combining the lens model with our gVriz photometry, we find a (unlensed) star formation rate (SFR) for the source galaxy of 32 h ^-1 M _sun yr^-1, adopting a fiducial constant SFR model with an age of 100 Myr and E(B - V) = 0.25. With an apparent magnitude of r = 19.8, this system is among the very brightest lensed z &gt;= 2 galaxies, and provides an excellent opportunity to pursue detailed studies of the physical properties of an individual high-redshift star-forming galaxy.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present new results from a continuing Keck program designed to study gravitational lens systems. We have obtained redshifts for three lens systems, SBS 0909+532, HST 1411+5211, and CLASS B2319+051. For all of these systems, either the source or lens redshift (or both) has been previously unidentified. Our observations provide some of these missing redshifts. We find (z_l,z_s)=(0.830,1.377) for SBS 0909+532 (z_l,z_s)=(0.465,2.811) for HST 1411+5211, although the source redshift is still tentative; and (z_l,1,z_l,2)=(0.624,0.588) for the two lensing galaxies in CLASS B2319+051. The background radio source in B2319+051 has not been detected optically; its redshift is, therefore, still unknown. We find that the spectral features of the central lensing galaxy in all three systems are typical of an early-type galaxy. The observed image splittings in SBS 0909+532 and HST 1411+5211 imply that the masses within the Einstein ring radii of the lensing galaxies are 1.4x10^11 and 2.0x10^11 h^-1 M_solar, respectively. The resulting B-band mass-to-light ratio (M/L) for HST 1411+5211 is 41.3Â±1.2 h (M/L)_solar, a factor of ~5 times higher than the average early-type lensing galaxy. This large mass-to-light ratio is almost certainly the result of the additional mass contribution from the cluster CL 3C 295 at z=0.46. For the lensing galaxy in SBS 0909+532, we measure (M/L)_B=4^+11_-3 h (M/L)_solar, where the large errors are the result of significant uncertainty in the galaxy luminosity. While we cannot measure directly the mass-to-light ratio of the lensing galaxy in B2319+051, we estimate that (M/L)_B is between 3-7 h (M/L)_solar.</abstract>

        <abstract>The authors report the discovery of a second gravitational lens system in the broad absorption line quasar H1413+117. Four images of comparable brightness are seen, separated by \equiv1 arcsec. The unique configuration of the images, together with the fairly rare occurrence of this type of quasar, makes it incontrovertible that this is a lensed system, not a cluster of quasars.

        <abstract>The paper reports the discovery of a new gravitational lens candidate: the high redshift (z = 3.803) and highly luminous (V = 17.5, M_V = -30.3) quasar Q 1208 + 1011. As derived from the analysis of direct CCD frames taken with the ESO/MPI 2.2 m telescope, this multiple quasar consists of two pointlike images, separated by 0.45 arcsec and characterized by a brightness ratio of 3.5, in red light. Existing spectroscopic data support the gravitational lens interpretation for this system but cannot exclude the hypothesis of a binary quasar. In the former case, the spectrum suggests that, if the metallic absorption line system reported by Steidel (1990) at a redshift z = 2.9157 is associated with the deflector, the mass of the lens should be of the order of M = 7.8 x 10 exp 11 solar masses. Evaluation of a recent HST PC frame obtained for Q 1208 + 1011 within the snapshot survey for gravitational lenses confirms the above results.</abstract>

        <abstract>Evidence is reported for gravitational lensing of the high-redshift (z = 3.8) quasar 1208 + 101, observed as part of the Snapshot survey with the HST Planetary Camera. An HST V image taken on gyroscopes resolves the quasar into three point-source components, with the two fainter images having separations of 0.1 and 0.5 arcsec from the central bright component. A radio observation of the quasar with the VLA at 2 cm shows that, like most quasars of this redhsift, 1208 + 101 is radio quiet. Based on positional information alone, the probability that the observed optical components are chance superpositions of Galactic stars is small, but not negligible. Analysis of a combined ground-based spectrum of all three components, using the relative brightnesses of the HST image, supports the lensing hypothesis. If all the components are lensed images of the quasar, the observed configuration cannot be reproduced by simple lens models.</abstract>

        <abstract>We compare new maps of the hot gas, dark matter, and galaxies for 1E 0657-56, a cluster with a rare high-velocity merger occurring nearly in the plane of the sky. The X-ray observations reveal a bullet-like gas subcluster just exiting the collision site. A prominent bow shock gives an estimate of the subcluster velocity, 4500 km s^-1, which lies mostly in the plane of the sky. The optical image shows that the gas lags behind the subcluster galaxies. The weak-lensing mass map reveals a dark matter clump lying ahead of the collisional gas bullet but coincident with the effectively collisionless galaxies. From these observations, one can directly estimate the cross section of the dark matter self-interaction. That the dark matter is not fluid-like is seen directly in the X-ray-lensing mass overlay; more quantitative limits can be derived from three simple independent arguments. The most sensitive constraint, sigma/mlt1 cm^2 g^-1, comes from the consistency of the subcluster mass-to-light ratio with the main cluster (and universal) value, which rules out a significant mass loss due to dark matter particle collisions. This limit excludes most of the 0.5-5 cm^2 g^-1 interval proposed to explain the flat mass profiles in galaxies. Our result is only an order-of-magnitude estimate that involves a number of simplifying, but always conservative, assumptions; stronger constraints may be derived using hydrodynamic simulations of this cluster.</abstract>

        <abstract>We have discovered a new gravitational lens in the Cosmic Lens All-Sky Survey. The lens B1555+375 is a four-image system with a maximum separation of 0.42". VLA and MERLIN radio observations show these images in a characteristic quadruple-lens configuration. Optical imaging with the Keck II Telescope at R band shows a faint extended object. We estimate the combined emission from the lens and background source to be R=25 mag. Observations at H band with the William Herschel Telescope also detected this extended object. The combined lens and background source magnitude was measured to be H=19 mag. Presently, redshifts for both the lensing galaxy and background source are undetermined. We conclude that one or more of the following are true: the lens galaxy is sub-L*, it has z&amp;gt;0.5, or it is highly reddened. The observed MERLIN component positions and flux densities can be well described by a lens model based on a singular isothermal ellipsoid mass distribution. Our best-fit lens model has a reduced chi^2 of 2.6. High-resolution VLA radio observations should help to constrain the lens model further.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present the discovery of CLASS B0739+366, a new gravitational lens system from the Cosmic Lens All-Sky Survey. Radio imaging of the source with the Very Large Array shows two compact components separated by 0.54", with a flux density ratio of ~6:1. High-resolution follow-up observations using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) at 1.7 GHz detect weak, parity-reversed jet emission from each of the radio components. Hubble Space Telescope Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) F160W observations detect infrared counterparts to the lensed images, as well as an extended object between them, which we identify as the lensing galaxy. Redshifts for the galaxy and lensed source have not yet been obtained. For typical lens and source redshifts of z=0.5 and z=1.5, respectively, preliminary mass modeling predicts a time delay of ~7 h^-1 days in a flat Omega_M=1.0 universe. The small predicted time delay and weak radio components will make CLASS B0739+366 a challenging target for Hubble constant determination.</abstract>

        <abstract>The sixth list of the Cal'an-Tololo Survey is presented. It contains information for 100 new southern quasars. The objects have a B magnitude in the range 16 &amp;#8804; B &lt; 20; for 81 objects 17.5 &amp;#8804; B &lt; 19. The redshifts z of these quasars are such that for 53 objects 1.8 &amp;#8804; z &lt; 2.4, for 20 objects 2.4 &amp;#8804; z &lt; 3.4 and for 27 quasars z &lt; 1.8. These quasars were found at Cerro Calan, searching objective prism plates taken at Cerro Tololo using the Curtis-Schmidt telescope, the thin UV prism and IIIaJ plates. Identification charts, equatorial coordinates, an estimated blue magnitude, B, and a preliminary redshift for every object are presented. All quasars in this list have been confirmed using slit spectroscopy.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report the discovery of a gravitationally lensed quasar identified serendipitously in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The object, SDSS J094604.90+183541.8, was initially targeted for spectroscopy as a luminous red galaxy, but the SDSS spectrum has the features of both a z = 0.388 galaxy and a z = 4.8 quasar. We have obtained additional imaging that resolves the system into two quasar images separated by 3farcs06 and a bright galaxy that is strongly blended with one of the quasar images. We confirm spectroscopically that the two quasar images represent a single-lensed source at z = 4.8 with a total magnification of 3.2, and we derive a model for the lensing galaxy. This is the highest redshift lensed quasar currently known. We examine the issues surrounding the selection of such an unusual object from existing data and briefly discuss implications for lensed quasar surveys.</abstract>

        <abstract>The gravitational lens system CLASS B2108+213 has two radio-loud lensed images separated by 4.56 arcsec. The relatively large image separation implies that the lensing is caused by a group of galaxies. In this paper, new optical imaging and spectroscopic data for the lensing galaxies of B2108+213 and the surrounding field galaxies are presented. These data are used to investigate the mass and composition of the lensing structure. The redshift and stellar velocity dispersion of the main lensing galaxy (G1) are found to be z = 0.3648 Â± 0.0002 and sigma_v = 325 Â± 25 kms^-1, respectively. The optical spectrum of the lensed quasar shows no obvious emission or absorption features, and is consistent with a BL Lac type radio source. However, the tentative detection of the G-band and Mg-b absorption lines, and a break in the spectrum of the host galaxy of the lensed quasar gives a likely source redshift of z = 0.67. Spectroscopy of the field around B2108+213 finds 51 galaxies at a similar redshift to G1, thus confirming that there is a much larger structure at z ~ 0.365 associated with this system. The width of the group velocity distribution is 694 Â± 93 kms^-1, but is non-Gaussian, implying that the structure is not yet viralized. The main lensing galaxy is also the brightest group member and has a surface brightness profile consistent with a typical cD galaxy. A lensing and dynamics analysis of the mass distribution, which also includes the newly found group members, finds that the logarithmic slope of the mass density profile is on average isothermal inside the Einstein radius, but steeper at the location of the Einstein radius. This apparent change in slope can be accounted for if an external convergence gradient, representing the underlying parent halo of the galaxy group, is included in the mass model.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present observations of CLASS B2108+213, the widest separation gravitational lens system discovered by the Cosmic Lens All-Sky Survey. Radio imaging using the VLA at 8.46 GHz and MERLIN at 5 GHz shows two compact components separated by 4.56 arcsec with a faint third component in between which we believe is emission from a lensing galaxy. 5-GHz VLBA observations reveal milliarcsecond-scale structure in the two lensed images that is consistent with gravitational lensing. Optical emission from the two lensed images and two lensing galaxies within the Einstein radius is detected in Hubble Space Telescope imaging. Furthermore, an optical gravitational arc, associated with the strongest lensed component, has been detected. Surrounding the system is a number of faint galaxies which may help explain the wide image separation. A plausible mass distribution model for CLASS B2108+213 is also presented.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present the optical spectra of four newly discovered gravitational lenses from the Cosmic Lens All-Sky Survey (CLASS). These observations were carried out using the Low-Resolution Imaging Spectrograph on the W. M. Keck-I Telescope as part of a programme to study galaxy-scale gravitational lenses. From our spectra, we found the redshift of the background source in CLASS B0128+437 (z_s= 3.1240 Â± 0.0042) and the lensing galaxy redshifts in CLASS B0445+123 (z_1= 0.5583 Â± 0.0003) and CLASS B0850+054 (z_l= 0.5883 Â± 0.0006). Intriguingly, we also discovered that CLASS B0631+519 may have two lensing galaxies (z_l,1= 0.0896 Â± 0.0001, z_l,2= 0.6196 Â± 0.0004). We also found a single unidentified emission line from the lensing galaxy in CLASS B0128+437 and the lensed source in CLASS B0850+054. We find the lensing galaxies in CLASS B0445+123 and CLASS B0631+519 (l, 2) to be early-type galaxies with Einstein radii of 2.8-3.0 h^-1 kpc. The deflector in CLASS B0850+054 is a late-type galaxy with an Einstein radius of 1.6 h^-1 kpc.</abstract>

        <abstract>The existence of flux ratio anomalies between fold and cusp images in galaxy-scale strong-lens systems has led to an interpretation based on the presence of a high mass fraction of cold dark matter (CDM) substructures around galaxies, as predicted by numerical N-body simulations. These substructures can cause large perturbations of the image magnifications, leading to changes in the image flux ratios. The flux ratio anomaly is particularly evident in the radio-loud quadruple gravitational lens system CLASS B2045+265. In this paper, new high-resolution radio, optical and infrared imaging of B2045+265 is presented which sheds more light on this anomaly and its possible causes. First, deep Very Long Baseline Array observations show very compact images, possibly with a hint of a jet, but with no evidence for differential scattering or scatter broadening. Hence, the flux ratio anomaly is unlikely to be caused by refractive scattering in either the Milky Way or the lens galaxy. Secondly, optical and infrared observations with the Hubble Space Telescope and through adaptive optics imaging with the W. M. Keck Telescope, show a previously undiscovered object - interpreted as a (tidally disrupted) dwarf satellite based on its colours and slight extension - between the main lens galaxy and the three anomalous flux ratio images. Thirdly, colour variations in the early-type lens galaxy indicate recent star formation, possibly the result of secondary infall of gas-rich satellites. A population of such galaxies around the lens system could explain the previously discovered strong [OII] emission. However, spiral structure and/or normal star formation in the lens galaxy cannot be excluded. In light of these new data, we propose a lens model for the system, including the observed dwarf satellite, which reproduces all positional and flux ratio constraints, without the need for additional CDM substructure. Although the model is peculiar in that the dwarf galaxy must be highly flattened, the model is very similar to recently proposed mass models based on high-order multipole expansions.</abstract>

        <abstract>We estimate the fraction of mass that is composed of compact objects in gravitational lens galaxies. This study is based on microlensing measurements (obtained from the literature) of a sample of 29 quasar image pairs seen through 20 lens galaxies. We determine the baseline for no microlensing magnification between two images from the ratios of emission line fluxes. Relative to this baseline, the ratio between the continua of the two images gives the difference in microlensing magnification. The histogram of observed microlensing events peaks close to no magnification and is concentrated below 0.6 mag, although two events of high magnification, Deltam ~ 1.5, are also present. We study the likelihood of the microlensing measurements using frequency distributions obtained from simulated microlensing magnification maps for different values of the fraction of mass in compact objects, alpha. The concentration of microlensing measurements close to Deltam ~ 0 can be explained only by simulations corresponding to very low values of alpha (10\% or less). A maximum likelihood test yields alpha = 0.05^+0.09 _-0.03 (90\% confidence interval) for a quasar continuum source of intrinsic size r_s_0\tilde 2.6 	imes 10^15 cm. This estimate is valid in the 0.1-10 M _sun range of microlens masses. We study the dependence of the estimate of alpha with r_s_0, and find that alpha lsim 0.1 for r_s_0\lsim 1.3 	imes 10^16 cm. High values of alpha are possible only for source sizes much larger than commonly expected (r_s_0\Gt 2.6 	imes 10^16 cm). Regarding the current controversy about Milky Way/LMC and M31 microlensing studies, our work supports the hypothesis of a very low content in MACHOS (Massive Compact Halo Objects). In fact, according to our study, quasar microlensing probably arises from the normal star populations of lens galaxies and there is no statistical evidence for MACHOS in the dark halos.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present images and long-slit spectra obtained with FORS1 at UT1 of the VLT centered on the gravitational arc of the galaxy cluster 1E0657-56 (z = 0.296). The cluster is one of the hottest, most massive clusters known so far and acts as a powerful gravitational telescope, amplifying the flux of background sources by up to a factor of 20. We present photometric results together with the spectra of the gravitational arc (z = 3.24) and four additional amplified high redshift objects (z = 2.34 to 3.08) that were also included in the slit by chance coincidence. A magnification map has been obtained from a lens model derived from the multiple image systems. We compare our observed spectra with models and briefly discuss the stellar contents of these galaxies. Furthermore we measured the equivalent widths of the C IV 1550 and Si IV 1400 absorption lines for the objects behind 1E0657-56 studied here, as well as for some additional starburst galaxies (nearby and at high z). For C IV we find an increasing absorption equivalent width with decreasing redshift. We discuss whether this correlation could be related to the increase of metallicity with the age of the universe. Based on observations obtained with FORS at Paranal at UT1 of the VLT.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report VLA observations of absorption in the 211 --&amp;gt; 212 transition of formaldehyde (H2CO) at a redshift of 0.68466 toward the Einstein ring gravitational lens system B0218+357. We observe the H2CO line at 8.6 GHz only toward the stronger of the two compact images of this system. The column densities of H2CO and other molecules previously observed at millimeter wavelengths, as well as their relative abundances, are comparable to the values one finds for molecular clouds within the Milky Way. We argue that the material seen in absorption has a molecular hydrogen column density between 5 x 1021 and 5 x 1022 cm-2.</abstract>

It appears to have unleashed 'dark', 'ghost', 'bullet' and 'stripped' substructures, each \\tilde10^14 M_â. The phenomenology is complex and will present a challenge for numerical simulations to reproduce. With new, multiband Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, we identify 34 strongly lensed images of 11 galaxies around the massive Southern 'core'. Combining this with weak-lensing data from HST, VLT and Subaru, we produce the most detailed mass map of this cluster to date. We also perform an independent analysis of archival Chandra X-ray imaging. Our analyses support a recent claim that the Southern core and Northwestern substructure are post-merger and exhibit morphology similar to the Bullet Cluster viewed from an angle. From the separation between X-ray emitting gas and lensing mass in the Southern core, we derive a new and independent constraint on the self-interaction cross-section of dark matter particles \sigma/m \&amp;lt; 3 \Â± 1 cm^2 g^-1. In the Northwestern substructure, the gas, dark matter and galaxy components have become separated by much larger distances. Most curiously, the 'ghost' clump (primarily gas) leads the 'dark' clump (primarily dark matter) by more than 150 kpc. We propose an enhanced 'ram-pressure slingshot' scenario which may have yielded this reversal of components with such a large separation, but needs further confirmation by follow-up observations and numerical simulations. A secondary merger involves a second 'bullet' clump in the North and an extremely 'stripped' clump to the West. The latter appears to exhibit the largest separation between dark matter and X-ray emitting baryons detected to date in our sky.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present mid-infrared imaging at 11.7 mum for the quadruple lens systems, MG0414+0534 and Q2237+030, using the cooled mid-infrared camera and spectrometer attached on the Subaru telescope. MG0414+0534 is characterized by a bright pair of lensed images (A1, A2) and their optical flux ratio A2/A1 deviates significantly from the prediction of a smooth-lens model. Q2237+030 is ''the Einstein Cross'' being comprised of four lensed images, which are significantly affected by microlensing in a foreground lensing galaxy. Our mid-infrared observations of these lensed images have revealed that the mid-infrared flux ratio for A2/A1 of MG0414+0534 is nearly unity (0.90 Â± 0.04). We find that this flux ratio is systematically small, at 4-5sigma level, compared with the prediction of a best smooth-lens model (1.09) represented by a singular isothermal ellipsoid and external shear. The smooth-lens model, which also considers the additional lensing effect of the possible faint satellite, object X, still provides a large flux ratio of A2/A1=1.06, thereby suggesting the presence of more substructures that can explain our observational result. In contrast, for Q2237+030, our high signal-to-noise observation indicates that the mid-infrared flux ratios between all the four images of Q2237+030 are virtually consistent with the prediction of a smooth-lens model. Based on the size estimate of the dust torus surrounding the nuclei of these QSOs, we set limits on the mass of a substructure in these lens systems, which can cause anomalies in the flux ratios. For MG0414+0534, since the required mass of a substructure inside its Einstein radius is gsim360 M _sun, millilensing by a cold dark matter substructure is most likely. If it is modeled as a singular isothermal sphere, the mass inside a radius of 100 pc is given as gsim1.0 \times 10^5 M _sun. For Q2237+030, there is no significant evidence of millilensing, so the reported anomalous flux ratios in shorter wavelengths are entirely caused due to microlensing by stars. Based on data collected at Subaru telescope, which is operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present the results of phase-referenced VLBA+Effelsberg observations at five frequencies of the double-image gravitational lens JVAS B0218+357, made to establish the precise registration of the A and B lensed image positions. The motivation behind these observations is to investigate the anomalous variation of the image flux-density ratio (A/B) with frequency - this ratio changes by almost a factor of two over a frequency range from 1.65 GHz to 15.35 GHz. We investigate whether frequency dependent image positions, combined with a magnification gradient across the image field, could give rise to the anomaly. Our observations confirm the variation of image flux-density ratio with frequency. The results from our phase-reference astrometry, taken together with the lens mass model of Wucknitz et al. (2004, MNRAS, 349, 14), show that shifts of the image peaks and centroids are too small to account for the observed frequency-dependent ratio.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present the first results from our spectroscopic survey of strong gravitational lens environments. Six of the eight lens galaxies in our sample belong to a poor group of galaxies, three of which are newly discovered here (those associated with BRI 0952-0115, MG 1654+1346, and B2114+022). For the three previously known groups (surrounding MG 0751+2716, PG 1115+080, and B1422+231), we more than double the number of group members. The group velocity dispersions range from 110^+170_-80 to 470^+100_-90 km s^-1. The higher velocity dispersions of the richer groups (MG 0751, PG 1115, and B1422) are consistent with those of nearby X-ray-luminous groups; the lower velocity dispersions of the other groups are more typical of dynamically younger groups. The lens galaxy is the brightest member in fewer than half of the groups. The brightest group galaxy is an early-type galaxy that, at least for the poorer groups, lies outside the group centroid and on an orbit indistinguishable from other group members. In at least three cases, MG 0751, PG 1115, and B1422, the group environment significantly affects the lens potential. These happen to be the quadruply imaged lenses in our sample, suggesting a connection between image configuration and environment. Finally, we assess the importance of line-of-sight mass structures, showing that, in principle, the lens potential may be affected by structures lying at a wide range of spatial and redshift offsets from the lens. We quantify the real line-of-sight effects, finding that four of the eight systems have substantial interloping structures and that at least one of those (behind MG 0751) significantly affects the lens potential.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report 10 lens candidates in the Extended Chandra Deep Field South from the GEMS survey. Nine of the systems are new detections and only one of the candidates is a known lens system. For the most promising five systems including the known lens system, we present results from preliminary lens mass modeling, which tests if the candidates are plausible lens systems. Photometric redshifts of the candidate lens galaxies are obtained from the COMBO-17 galaxy catalog. Stellar masses of the candidate lens galaxies within the Einstein radius are obtained by using the z-band luminosity and the V-z color-based stellar mass-to-light ratios. As expected, the lensing masses are found to be larger than the stellar masses of the candidate lens galaxies. These candidates have similar dark matter fractions as compared to lenses in SLACS and COSMOS. They also roughly follow the halo-mass-stellar-mass relation predicted by the subhalo abundance matching technique. One of the candidate lens galaxies qualifies as a luminous infrared galaxy and may not be a true lens because the arc-like feature in the system is likely to be an active region of star formation in the candidate lens galaxy. Among the five best candidates, one is a confirmed lens system, one is likely a lens system, two are less likely to be lenses, and the status of one of the candidates is ambiguous. Spectroscopic follow-up of these systems is still required to confirm lensing and/or for more accurate determination of the lens masses and mass density profiles.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present the Strong Lensing Legacy Survey-ARCS (SARCS) sample compiled from the final T0006 data release of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS) covering a total non-overlapping area of 159 deg^2. We adopt a semi-automatic method to find gravitational arcs in the survey that makes use of an arc-finding algorithm. The candidate list is pruned by visual inspection and ranking to form the final SARCS sample. This list also includes some serendipitously discovered lens candidates which the automated algorithm did not detect. The SARCS sample consists of 127 lens candidates which span arc radii ~2''-18'' within the unmasked area of ~150 deg^2. Within the sample, 54 systems are promising lenses among which, we find 12 giant arcs (length-to-width ratio &gt;=8). We also find two radial arc candidates in SL2SJ141447+544704. From our sample, we detect a systematic alignment of the giant arcs with the major axis of the baryonic component of the putative lens in concordance with previous studies. This alignment is also observed for all arcs in the sample and does not vary significantly with increasing arc radius. The mean values of the photometric redshift distributions of lenses corresponding to the giant arcs and all arcs sample are at z ~ 0.6. Owing to the large area and depth of the CFHTLS, we find the largest sample of lenses probing mass scales that are intermediate to cluster and galaxy lenses for the first time. We compare the observed image separation distribution (ISD) of our arcs with theoretical models. A two-component density profile for the lenses which accounts for both the central galaxy and the dark matter component is required by the data to explain the observed ISD. Unfortunately, current levels of uncertainties and degeneracies accommodate models both with and without adiabatic contraction. We also show the effects of changing parameters of the model that predict the ISD and that a larger lens sample might constrain relations such as the concentration-mass relation, mass-luminosity relation, and the faint-end slope of the luminosity function. Based on observations obtained with MegaPrime/MegaCam, a joint project of CFHT and CEA/DAPNIA, at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) which is operated by the National Research Council (NRC) of Canada, the Institut National des Science de l'Univers of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) of France, and the University of Hawaii.

        <abstract>MG 2016+112 is a quadruply imaged lens system with two complete images A and B and a pair of merging partial images in region C as seen in the radio. The merging images are found to violate the expected mirror symmetry. This indicates an astrometric anomaly which could only be of gravitational origin and could arise due to substructure in the environment or line of sight of the lens galaxy. We present new high-resolution multifrequency very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations at 1.7, 5 and 8.4 GHz. Three new components are detected in the new VLBI imaging of both the lensed images A and B. The expected opposite parity of the lensed images A and B was confirmed due to the detection of non-collinear components. Furthermore, the observed properties of the newly detected components are inconsistent with the predictions of previous mass models. We present new scenarios for the background quasar which are consistent with the new observations. We also investigate the role of the satellite galaxy situated at the same redshift as the main lensing galaxy. Our new mass models demonstrate quantitatively that the satellite galaxy is the primary cause of the astrometric anomaly found in region C. The detected satellite is consistent with the abundance of subhaloes expected in the halo from cold dark matter (CDM) simulations. However, the fraction of the total halo mass in the satellite as computed from lens modelling is found to be higher than that predicted by CDM simulations.</abstract>

        <abstract>The gravitational lens system CLASS B2108+213 has two lensed images separated by 4.56arcsec. Such a wide image separation suggests that the lens is either a massive galaxy or composed of a group of galaxies. To investigate the structure of the lensing potential we have carried out new high-resolution imaging of the two lensed images at 1.7GHz with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) and at 5GHz with global Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI). Compact and extended emission is detected from the two lensed images, which provides additional constraints to the lensing mass model. We find that the data are consistent with either a single lensing galaxy or a two galaxy lens model that takes account of a nearby companion to the main lensing galaxy within the Einstein radius of the system. However, for an ensemble of global power-law mass models, those with density profiles steeper than isothermal are a better fit. The best-fitting profile for a single spherical mass model has a slope of gamma = 2.45^+0.19_-0.18. The system also has a third radio component which is coincident with the main lensing galaxy. This component is detected at milliarcsecond scales for the first time by the 1.7-GHz VLBA and 5-GHz global VLBI imaging. However, the third radio component is found not to be consistent with a core lensed image because the radio spectrum differs from the two lensed images, and its flux density is too high when compared to what is expected from simple mass models with a variable power-law density profile and/or a reasonable core radius. Furthermore, 1.4GHz imaging of the system with the Multi-Element Radio Link Interferometric Network (MERLIN) finds extended lobe emission on either side of the main lensing galaxy. Therefore, the radio emission from the third radio component is almost certainly from an active galactic nucleus (AGN) within the main lensing galaxy, which is classified as a Fanaroff-Riley I (FRI) type radio source.</abstract>

        <abstract>We analyzed the microlensing of the X-ray and optical emission of the lensed quasar PG 1115+080. We find that the effective radius of the X-ray emission is 1.3^+1.1_-0.5 dex smaller than that of the optical emission. Viewed as a thin disk observed at inclination angle i, the optical accretion disk has a scale length, defined by the point where the disk temperature matches the rest-frame energy of the monitoring band (kT=hc/lambda_rest with lambda_rest=0.3 mum), of log\(r_s,opt/cm)[cos(i)/0.5^1/2\=16.6Â±0.4. The X-ray emission region (1.4-21.8 keV in the rest frame) has an effective half-light radius of log(r_1/2,X/cm)=15.6^+0.6_-0.9. Given an estimated black hole mass of 1.2\times10^9 M_solar, corresponding to a gravitational radius of log(r_g/cm)=14.3, the X-ray emission is generated near the inner edge of the disk, while the optical emission comes from scales slightly larger than those expected for an Eddington-limited thin disk. We find a weak trend supporting models with low stellar mass fractions near the lensed images, in mild contradiction to inferences from the stellar velocity dispersion and the time delays.

        <abstract>We analyze V-, I-, and H-band HST images and two seasons of R-band monitoring data for the gravitationally lensed quasar SDSS 0924+0219. We clearly see that image D is a point-source image of the quasar at the center of its host galaxy. We can easily track the host galaxy of the quasar close to image D because microlensing has provided a natural coronograph that suppresses the flux of the quasar image by roughly an order of magnitude. We observe low-amplitude, uncorrelated variability between the four quasar images due to microlensing, but no correlated variations that could be used to measure a time delay. Monte Carlo models of the microlensing variability provide estimates of the mean stellar mass in the lens galaxy (0.03 h^2 M_solar&amp;lt;~&amp;lt;M&amp;gt;&amp;lt;~2.0 h^2 M_solar), the accretion disk size (the disk temperature is 5	imes10^4 K at 1.3	imes10^14 h^-1 cm&amp;lt;~r_s&amp;lt;~4.7	imes10^14 h^-1 cm), and the black hole mass (6.6	imes10^6 M_solar&amp;lt;~M_BH h^3/2 eta^-1/2_0.1 (L/L_Edd)^1/2&amp;lt;~4.4	imes10^7 M_solar), all at 68\% confidence. The black hole mass estimate based on microlensing is mildly inconsistent with an estimate of M_BH=(2.8Â±0.9)	imes10^8 M_solar from the Mg II emission-line width. If we extrapolate the best-fitting light curve models into the future, we expect images A and B to fade and images C and D to brighten. In particular, we estimate that image D has a roughly 16\% probability of brightening by a factor of 2 during the next year and a 40\% probability of brightening by an order of magnitude over the next decade. Based on observations obtained with the Small and Moderate Aperture Research Telescope System (SMARTS) 1.3 m, which is operated by the SMARTS Consortium; the Apache Point Observatory 3.5 m telescope, which is owned and operated by the Astrophysical Research Consortium; the WIYN Observatory, which is owned and operated by the University of Wisconsin, Indiana University, Yale University and the National Optical Astronomy Observatories (NOAO); the 6.5 m Magellan Baade telescope, which is a collaboration between the observatories of the Carnegie Institution of Washington (OCIW), University of Arizona, Harvard University, University of Michigan, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology; and observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope for program HST-GO-9744 of the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present our ground-based optical imaging, spectral analysis, and high-resolution radio mapping of the gravitational lens candidate FBQ 1633+3134. This z=1.52, B=17.7 quasar appears double on CCD images with an image separation of 0.66'' and a relatively constant flux ratio of ~3:1 across B, V, R, and I filters. A single 0.27 mJy radio source is detected at 8.46 GHz, coincident within an arcsecond of both optical components, but no companion at radio wavelengths is detected for the system down to a flux level of 0.1 mJy (3 sigma). Spectral observations reveal a rich metal-line absorption system consisting of a strong Mg II doublet and associated Fe I and Fe II absorption features, all at an intervening redshift of z=0.684, suggestive of a lensing galaxy. Point-spread function subtraction of ground-based images however shows no obvious signs of a third object between the two quasar images and places a detection limit of I&amp;gt;~23.0 if such an object exists. Although the possibility that FBQ 1633+3134 is a binary quasar cannot be ruled out, the evidence presented here is consistent with FBQ 1633+3134 being a single quasar lensed by a faint, metal-rich galaxy. Based on observations carried out in part at the MDM Observatory, the W. M. Keck Observatory, and the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) Very Large Array.

        <abstract>We report the discovery of two new gravitationally lensed quasars, WFI J2026-4536 and WFI J2033-4723, at respective source redshifts of z=2.23 and z=1.66. Both systems are quadruply imaged and have similar PG 1115-like image configurations. WFI J2026-4536 has a maximum image separation of 1.4'', a total brightness of g=16.5, and a relatively simple lensing environment, while WFI J2033-4723 has a maximum image separation of 2.5'', an estimated total brightness of g~17.9, and a more complicated environment of at least six galaxies within 20''. The primary lensing galaxies are detected for both systems after point-spread function subtraction. Several of the broadband flux ratios in these systems show a strong (0.1-0.4 mag) trend with wavelength, suggesting either microlensing or differential extinction through the lensing galaxy. For WFI J2026-4536, the total quasar flux has dimmed by 0.1 mag in the blue but only half as much in the red over 3 months, suggestive of microlensing-induced variations. For WFI J2033-4723, resolved spectra of some of the quasar components reveal emission-line flux ratios that agree better with the macromodel predictions than either the broadband or continuum ratios, also indicative of microlensing. The predicted differential time delays for WFI J2026-4536 are short, ranging from 1 to 2 weeks for the long delay, but are longer for WFI J2033-4723, ranging from 1 to 2 months. Both systems hold promise for future monitoring campaigns aimed at microlensing or time delay studies. Based on observations obtained with the MPG/ESO 2.2 m telescope, the CTIO 1.5 m telescope, and the Clay and Baade 6.5 m telescopes at the Las Campanas Magellan Observatories. Also based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Rsearch in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.

        <abstract>We report the discovery and ground-based observations of the new gravitational lens CTQ 414. The source quasar lies at a redshift of z=1.29 with a B magnitude of 17.6. Ground-based optical imaging reveals two point sources separated by 1.2'' with a magnitude difference of roughly 1 mag. Subtraction of two stellar point-spread functions from images obtained in subarcsecond seeing consistently leaves behind a faint, residual object. Fits for two point sources plus an extended object places the fainter object collinear with the two brighter components. Subsequent Hubble Space Telescope Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) observations have confirmed the identification of the fainter object as the lensing galaxy. Very Large Array observations at 8.46 GHz reveal that all components of the lensing system are radio-quiet down to the 0.2 mJy flux level.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present the second gravitationally lensed quasar discovered during the course of a Hubble Space Telescope Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph snapshot survey for small-separation gravitational lenses. CTQ 327 is a double quasar with an image separation of 1.22'' and a g-band flux ratio of roughly 5 to 1. Spectra reveal both components to be z=1.37 quasars, and the lensing galaxy is clearly visible after point-spread function subtraction of the two quasar components. The light profile of the lensing galaxy is well modeled by an r^1/4 law, indicative of an early-type elliptical galaxy. An estimate of the lens galaxy redshift is z~0.4-0.6, based on the Faber-Jackson relationship and photometric considerations, although values outside this range are still consistent with the present data. Resolved spectra of the two quasars show similar, but not identical, continuum and emission-line features: component A exhibits weaker emission lines with respect to the continuum than does component B, and there is evidence of intrinsic differences in the emission-line profiles between the two components. Optical monitoring of the quasar pair also shows a change in the g-band flux ratio of 0.14 mag over a 3 month period. These spectral and photometric differences may be due to microlensing fluctuations from stars in the lensing galaxy, intrinsic quasar variability coupled with the system's differential time delay, or some combination of the two. The observed variability makes CTQ 327 an attractive target for future flux monitoring, aimed at time-delay or microlensing studies.

        <abstract>We report that the Sloan Digital Sky Survey quasar SDSS J165043.44+425149.3 is gravitationally lensed into two images, based on observations obtained with the WIYN 3.5 m telescope at the Kitt Peak National Observatory. The lensed quasar, at a redshift of z=1.547, appears as two images separated by 1.2" with B-band magnitudes of 17.8 and 20.0. The lensing galaxy is clearly detected in I-band images obtained in 0.3" seeing after point-spread function subtraction of the two quasar images. A strong metal-line absorption system is also identified in the unresolved SDSS spectrum of the double quasar, suggesting a plausible lens redshift of z=0.58. The UBRI flux ratios of the pair vary significantly, from 8.5:1 in the blue to 5.4:1 in the red, a difference of 0.5 mag, and are likely due to differential reddening through the lensing galaxy, microlensing in one or both quasar images, or some combination of the two. Optical monitoring of the quasar pair, particularly at blue wavelengths, will be needed to determine if microlensing is indeed significant. The predicted differential time delay between the quasar images is on the order of 1 month, assuming the intervening absorption system is due to the lensing galaxy.

        <abstract>Gravitational microlensing is a powerful tool for probing the physical properties of quasar accretion disks and properties of the lens galaxy such as its dark matter fraction and mean stellar mass. Unfortunately, the number of lensed quasars (~90) exceeds our monitoring capabilities. Thus, estimating their microlensing properties is important for identifying good microlensing candidates as well as for the expectations of future surveys. In this work, we estimate the microlensing properties of a sample of 87 lensed quasars. While the median Einstein radius crossing timescale is 20.6 years, the median source crossing timescale is 7.3 months. Broadly speaking, this means that on ~10 year timescales roughly half the lenses will be quiescent, with the source in a broad demagnified valley, and roughly half will be active with the source lying in the caustic ridges. We also found that the location of the lens system relative to the cosmic microwave background dipole has a modest effect on microlensing timescales, and in theory microlensing could be used to confirm the kinematic origin of the dipole. As a corollary of our study we analyzed the accretion rate parameters in a sub-sample of 32 lensed quasars. At fixed black hole mass, it is possible to sample a broad range of luminosities (i.e., Eddington factors) if it becomes feasible to monitor fainter lenses.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present observations of wavelength-dependent flux ratios for four gravitational lens systems (SDSS J1650+4251, HE 0435-1223, FBQ 0951+2635, and Q 0142-100) obtained with the Nordic Optical Telescope. The use of narrowband photometry, as well as the excellent seeing conditions during the observations, allows us to study their chromatic behavior. For SDSS J1650+4251, we determine the extinction curve of the dust in the z_L = 0.58 lens galaxy and find that the 2175 AA feature is absent. In the case of HE 0435-1223, we clearly detect chromatic microlensing. This allows us to estimate the wavelength-dependent size of the accretion disk. We find an R-band disk size of r^R _s = 13 Â± 5 light days for a linear prior on r^R _s and r^R _s = 7 Â± 6 light days for a logarithmic prior. For a power-law size-wavelength scaling of r_s vprop lambda^ p , we were able to constrain the value of the exponent to p = 1.3 Â± 0.3 for both r^R _s priors, which is in agreement with the temperature profiles of simple thin disk models (p = 4/3).</abstract>

        <abstract>We report on a visual search for galaxy-scale strong gravitational lenses over 650 arcmin2 of HST ACS (V606 and I814) imaging in the DEEP2 Extended Groth Strip. This field has Keck DEIMOS spectroscopy of ~14,000 galaxies (~75% complete to RAB&lt;24.1). We identify three strong galaxy-galaxy lenses: HST J141735+522646 is a previously known four-image lens (the "Cross" zl=0.8106, zs=3.40); HST J141820+523611 (the "Dewdrop" zl=0.5798, zs=0.9818) features two pairs of arcs; and HST J141833+524352 (the "Anchor" zl=0.4625, no zs) has one pair of arcs. Based on a normalized local density (1+delta3), lenses are found to be in both under- and overdense local environments. All three lenses are fit well by singular isothermal ellipsoid models including external shear, with chi2nu~1. The model shears are ~10%. Approximating all line-of-sight galaxies as singular isothermal sphere halos truncated at 200 h-1 kpc, with masses estimated through the Faber-Jackson relation, infers shears of ~2%, much smaller than those required by the models. Therefore, the corresponding convergence estimates must also be suspect. If more realistic treatment of galaxies (and the large-scale structure that they are embedded in) were to match the inferred shears to the model shears, then the true convergence could be measured and the mass-sheet degeneracy broken.</abstract>

        <abstract>The line of sight to the quasar B0218+357, one of the most studied lensed systems, intercepts a z = 0.68 spiral galaxy, which splits its image into two main components A and B, separated by ca. 0.3 arcsec, and gives rise to molecular absorption. Although the main absorption component has been shown to arise in front of image A, it is not established whether some absorption from other velocity components is also occuring in front of image B. To tackle this question, we have observed the HCO^+(2-1) absorption line during the commissioning phase of the new very extended configuration of the Plateau de Bure Interferometer, in order to trace the position of the absorption as a function of frequency. Visibility fitting of the self-calibrated data allowed us to achieve position accuracy between ~12 and 80 mas per velocity component. Our results clearly demonstrate that all the different velocity components of the HCO^+(2-1) absorption arise in front of the south-west image A of the quasar. We estimate a flux ratio f_A/f_B = 4.2 _-1.0 ^+1.8 at 106 GHz.</abstract>

The system RX J0921+4529 contains two z_s=1.66 quasars separated by 6.93'' with an H-band magnitude difference of Deltam=1.39. The HST NIC2 H-band images reveal an H=18.2 spiral galaxy between the quasar images, which is probably a member of a z_l=0.32 X-ray cluster centered on the field. We detect an extended source near the fainter quasar image but not in the brighter image. If this extended source is the host galaxy of the fainter quasar, then the system is a binary quasar rather than a gravitational lens. VLA observations at 3.6 cm reveal emission from the lens galaxy at the flux level of 1 mJy and a marginal detection of the brighter quasar. Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by AURA, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555. Based on observations obtained at the Multiple Mirror Telescope Observatory, a facility operated jointly by the University of Arizona and the Smithsonian Institution.</abstract>

        <abstract>The first phase of a large gravitational lens survey using the Very Large Array at a wavelength of 3.6 cm has been completed, yielding images for 3258 radio sources. The Cosmic Lens All-Sky Survey (CLASS) is designed to locate gravitational lens systems consisting of multiply imaged compact components with separations greater than 0."2 . We report here the first discovery of a gravitational lens from the survey: 1608+656, a quadruply imaged object with a maximum separation of 2."1 . Images from the Palomar 5 m and Keck 10 m telescopes show the lensed images and the lensing galaxy. An optical spectrum obtained with the Palomar 5 m telescope indicates a redshift of z=0.6304 for the lensing galaxy. No conclusive redshift for the lensed object has been determined, although a single strong emission line is found at 9240 A in the Keck low-resolution imaging spectrograph spectrum. The two most likely identifications for this line are H beta ( z=0.90 ) and Mg II ( z=2.30 ). The preliminary lens model derived from the radio image reproduces the observed configuration and relative fluxes of the images, as well as the position, shape, and orientation of the lensing galaxy. Because a simple mass model is able to fit the observations, we argue that this lens system is promising for determining H_0 .</abstract>

        <abstract>The third phase of the Cosmic Lens All-Sky Survey (CLASS) has recently been completed, bringing the total number of sources imaged to over 15,000 in the CLASS and Jodrell-VLA Astrometric Survey combined survey. In the VLA observations carried out in 1998 March and April, two new candidate lensed systems were discovered: CLASS B1152+199 and B1359+154. B1152+199 is a 1.6" double, with a background quasar at z=1.019 lensed by a foreground galaxy at z=0.439. The relatively flat radio spectra of the lensed images (alpha^14.94_8.46=-0.32), combined with a previous ROSAT detection of the source, make B1152+199 a strong candidate for time delay studies at both radio and X-ray wavelengths. B1359+154 is a quadruply lensed quasar at z=3.235, with a maximum image separation of 1.7". As yet, the redshift of the lensing object in this system is undetermined. The steep spectral index of the source (alpha^14.94_8.46=-0.9) suggests that B1359+154 will not exhibit strong variability and is therefore unlikely to be useful for determining H_0 from measured time delays.</abstract>

        <abstract>A gravitational lens model is presented for the newly discovered 10-image system B1933+503. The underlying object, revealed by modelling, is a triple radio source on the scale of a couple of hundred mas that is well-aligned along the line of sight with a foreground and somewhat flattened lensing galaxy, the orientation and location of which match those of an observed galaxy, known to be at a redshift of 0.755. Uncertainties in the modelling are obtained by a Monte Carlo exercise. Observational tests of the lens model are proposed, and the time delays between various pairs of images are determined, as the core of the source is known to be significantly variable. Future observations of the lens hold the key to using B1933+503 to constrain Hubble's constant. Despite the absence of a source redshift, the utility of the system as a probe of the structure of the lens galaxy is unparalleled as it provides a surfeit of easily identifiable constraints for modelling the system.</abstract>

        <abstract>Galaxy-scale strong gravitational lens systems are useful for a variety of astrophysical applications. However, their use is limited by the relatively small samples of lenses known to date. It is thus important to develop efficient ways to discover new systems both in present and forthcoming data sets. For future large high-resolution imaging surveys we anticipate an ever-growing need for efficiency and for independence from spectroscopic data. In this paper, we exploit the clustering of massive galaxies to perform a high-efficiency imaging search for gravitational lenses. Our data set comprises 44 fields imaged by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS), each of which is centered on a lens discovered by the Strong Lens ACS Survey (SLACS). We compare four different search methods: (1) automated detection with the HST Archive Galaxy-scale Gravitational Lens Survey (HAGGLeS) robot, (2) examining cutout images of bright galaxies (BGs) after subtraction of a smooth galaxy light distribution, (3) examining the unsubtracted BG cutouts, and (4) performing a full-frame visual inspection of the ACS images. We compute purity and completeness and consider investigator time for the four algorithms, using the main SLACS lenses as a testbed. The first and second algorithms perform the best. We present the four new lens systems discovered during this comprehensive search, as well as one other likely candidate. For each new lens we use the fundamental plane to estimate the lens velocity dispersion and predict, from the resulting lens geometry, the redshifts of the lensed sources. Two of these new systems are found in galaxy clusters, which include the SLACS lenses in the two respective fields. Overall we find that the enhanced lens abundance (30^+24 _-8 lenses deg^-2) is higher than expected for random fields (12^+4 _-2 lenses deg^-2 for the COSMOS survey). Additionally, we find that the gravitational lenses we detect are qualitatively different from those in the parent SLACS sample: this imaging survey is largely probing higher redshift, and lower mass, early-type galaxies.</abstract>

        <abstract>We exploit the strong lensing effect to explore the properties of intrinsically faint and compact galaxies at intermediate redshift (z _s ~= 0.4-0.8) at the highest possible resolution at optical wavelengths. Our sample consists of 46 strongly lensed emission line galaxies (ELGs) discovered by the Sloan Lens ACS Survey (SLACS). The galaxies have been imaged at high resolution with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) in three bands (V_HST , I _814, and H _160), allowing us to infer their size, luminosity, and stellar mass using stellar population synthesis models. Lens modeling is performed using a new fast and robust code, KLENS, which we test extensively on real and synthetic non-lensed galaxies, and also on simulated galaxies multiply imaged by SLACS-like galaxy-scale lenses. Our tests show that our measurements of galaxy size, flux, and S'ersic index are robust and accurate, even for objects intrinsically smaller than the HST point-spread function. The median magnification is 8.8, with a long tail that extends to magnifications above 40. Modeling the SLACS sources reveals a population of galaxies with colors and S'ersic indices (median n ~ 1) consistent with the galaxies detected with HST in the Galaxy Evolution from Morphology and SEDs (GEMS) and Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) surveys, but that are (typically) ~2 mag fainter and ~5 times smaller in apparent size than GEMS and ~4 mag brighter than but similar in size to HUDF. The size-stellar-mass and size-luminosity relations for the SLACS sources are offset to smaller sizes with respect to both comparison samples. The closest analog are ultracompact ELGs identified by HST grism surveys. The lowest mass galaxies in our sample are comparable to the brightest Milky Way satellites in stellar mass (10^7 M _sun) and have well-determined half-light radii of 0farcs05 (ap0.3 kpc).</abstract>

        <abstract>We report the observation and confirmation of the first group- and cluster-scale strong gravitational lensing systems found in Dark Energy Survey data. Through visual inspection of data from the Science Verification season, we identified 53 candidate systems. We then obtained spectroscopic follow-up of 21 candidates using the Gemini Multi-object Spectrograph at the Gemini South telescope and the Inamori-Magellan Areal Camera and Spectrograph at the Magellan/Baade telescope. With this follow-up, we confirmed six candidates as gravitational lenses: three of the systems are newly discovered, and the remaining three were previously known. Of the 21 observed candidates, the remaining 15 either were not detected in spectroscopic observations, were observed and did not exhibit continuum emission (or spectral features), or were ruled out as lensing systems. The confirmed sample consists of one group-scale and five galaxy-cluster-scale lenses. The lensed sources range in redshift z \tilde 0.80-3.2 and in i-band surface brightness i _SB \tilde 23-25 mag arcsec^-2 (2\Prime aperture). For each of the six systems, we estimate the Einstein radius Î¸s _E and the enclosed mass M _enc, which have ranges Î¸s _E \tilde 5\Prime-9\Prime and M _enc \tilde 8 \times 10^12 to 6 \times 10^13 M _â, respectively.

        <abstract>The use of gravitationally lensed quasars for cosmological applications and as probes of galaxy structure and evolution requires knowledge about the lens redshift, which is unknown for a large fraction of lenses. We report Very Large Telescope observations of 11 lensed quasars, designed to measure the redshifts of their lens galaxies. We successfully determined the redshifts for seven systems, five of which were previously unknown. The securely measured redshifts for the lensing galaxies are: HE 0047-1756 z=0.408; PMN J0134-0931 z=0.766; HE 0230-2130 z=0.522; HE 0435-1223 z=0.455; SDSS 0924+021 z=0.393; LBQS 1009-025 z=0.871; and WFI J2033-472 z=0.658, all with uncertainties of 0.001. For four additional systems (BR I0952-0115, Q1017-207, Q1355-2257, and PMN J1632-003) we estimate tentative redshifts based on some features in their spectra.</abstract>

        <abstract>Highly magnified lensed galaxies allow us to probe the morphological and spectroscopic properties of high-redshift stellar systems in great detail. However, such objects are rare, and there are only a handful of lensed galaxies that are bright enough for a high-resolution spectroscopic study with current instrumentation. We report the discovery of a new massive lensing cluster, SDSSJ120923.7+264047, at z = 0.558. Present around the cluster core, at angular distances of up to ~40 arcsec, are many arcs and arc candidates, presumably due to lensing of background galaxies by the cluster gravitational potential. One of the arcs, 21 arcsec long, has an r-band magnitude of 20, making it one of the brightest known lensed galaxies. We obtained a low-resolution spectrum of this galaxy, using the Keck-I telescope, and found it is at redshift of z = 1.018.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present a strong lens analysis of SDSS J1004+4112, a unique quasar lens produced by a massive cluster of galaxies at z = 0.68, using newly developed software for gravitational lensing. We find that our parametric mass model well reproduces all observations, including the positions of quasar images as well as those of multiply imaged galaxies with measured spectroscopic redshifts, time delays between quasar images, and the positions of faint central images. The predicted large total magnification of mu 	ilde 70 suggests that the lens system is indeed a useful site for studying the fine structure of a distant quasar and its host galaxy. The dark halo component is found to be unimodal, centered on the brightest cluster galaxy and the Chandra X-ray surface brightness profile. In addition, the orientation of the halo component is quite consistent with those of the brightest cluster galaxy and member galaxy distribution, implying that the lensing cluster is a relaxed system. The radial profile of the best-fit mass model is in good agreement with a mass profile inferred from the X-ray observation. While the inner radial slope of the dark halo component is consistent with being -1, a clear dependence of the predicted A-D time delay on the slope indicates that an additional time-delay measurement will improve constraints on the mass model.</abstract>

        <abstract>We study the mass distribution of a sample of 28 galaxy clusters using strong and weak lensing observations. The clusters are selected via their strong lensing properties as part of the Sloan Giant Arcs Survey (SGAS) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Mass modelling of the strong lensing information from the giant arcs is combined with weak lensing measurements from deep Subaru/Suprime-cam images to primarily obtain robust constraints on the concentration parameter and the shape of the mass distribution. We find that the concentration c_vir is a steep function of the mass, c_vir\propM^-0.59Â±0.12_vir, with the value roughly consistent with the lensing-bias-corrected theoretical expectation for high-mass (\tilde10^15 h^-1 M_â) clusters. However, the observationally inferred concentration parameters appear to be much higher at lower masses (\tilde10^14 h^-1 M_â), possibly a consequence of the modification to the inner density profiles provided by baryon cooling. The steep mass-concentration relation is also supported from direct stacking analysis of the tangential shear profiles. In addition, we explore the 2D shape of the projected mass distribution by stacking weak lensing shear maps of individual clusters with prior information on the position angle from strong lens modelling, and find significant evidence for a large mean ellipticity with the best-fitting value of &amp;lt;e&amp;gt;= 0.47 Â± 0.06 for the mass distribution of the stacked sample. We find that the luminous cluster member galaxy distribution traces the overall mass distribution very well, although the distribution of fainter cluster galaxies appears to be more extended than the total mass. ^ a Photometric redshifts estimated from the SDSS data, as spectroscopic cluster redshifts are not available for these clusters. ^ b Based on the spectroscopy of the brightest cluster galaxy at Apache Point Observatory 3.5-m telescope. ^ c We use deep R_c-band images retrieved from SMOKA instead of obtaining r-band follow-up images.

        <abstract>We derive radial mass profiles of four strong lensing selected clusters which show prominent giant arcs (Abell 1703, SDSS J1446+3032, SDSS J1531+3414, and SDSS J2111-0115), by combining detailed strong lens modeling with weak lensing shear measured from deep Subaru Suprime-cam images. Weak lensing signals are detected at high significance for all four clusters, whose redshifts range from z = 0.28 to 0.64. We demonstrate that adding strong lensing information with known arc redshifts significantly improves constraints on the mass density profile, compared with those obtained from weak lensing alone. While the mass profiles are well fitted by the universal form predicted in N-body simulations of the Lambda-dominated cold dark matter model, all four clusters appear to be slightly more centrally concentrated (the concentration parameters c _vir ~ 8) than theoretical predictions, even after accounting for the bias toward higher concentrations inherent in lensing-selected samples. Our results are consistent with previous studies which similarly detected a concentration excess, and increase the total number of clusters studied with the combined strong and weak lensing technique to 10. Combining our sample with previous work, we find that clusters with larger Einstein radii are more anomalously concentrated. We also present a detailed model of the lensing cluster Abell 1703 with constraints from multiple image families, and find the dark matter inner density profile to be cuspy with the slope consistent with -1, in agreement with expectations.

        <abstract>We present the discovery of a new quadruply lensed quasar. The lens system, SDSS J1330+1810 at z_s = 1.393, was identified as a lens candidate from the spectroscopic sample of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Optical and near-infrared images clearly show four quasar images with a maximum image separation of 1.76 arcsec, as well as a bright lensing galaxy. We measure a redshift of the lensing galaxy of z_l = 0.373 from absorption features in the spectrum. We find a foreground group of galaxies at z = 0.31, centred at ~120 arcsec south-west of the lens system. Simple mass models fit the data quite well, including the flux ratios between images, although the lens galaxy appears to be ~1 mag brighter than expected by the Faber-Jackson relation. Our mass modelling suggests that shear from nearby structure is affecting the lens potential. This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5-m Magellan telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.

        <abstract>We report on the discovery of the two-image gravitationally lensed quasar SDSSJ1335+0118. The object was selected as a lens candidate from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The imaging and spectroscopic follow-up observations confirm that the system exhibits two gravitationally lensed images of a quasar at z = 1.57. The image separation is 1".56. We also detect an extended component between the two quasar images, likely to be a lensing galaxy. Preliminary mass modeling predicts a differential time delay, Delta t of ~30 h^-1 day, assuming the redshift of the lens galaxy to be 0.5.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present the discovery of four gravitationally lensed quasars selected from the spectroscopic quasar catalog of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We describe imaging and spectroscopic follow-up observations that support the lensing interpretation of the following four quasars: SDSS J0832+0404 (image separation thetas = 198, source redshift z_s = 1.115, lens redshift z_l = 0.659); SDSS J1216+3529 (thetas = 149, z_s = 2.012); SDSS J1322+1052 (thetas = 200, z_s = 1.716); and SDSS J1524+4409 (thetas = 167, z_s = 1.210, z_l = 0.320). Each system has two lensed images. We find that the fainter image component of SDSS J0832+0404 is significantly redder than the brighter component, perhaps because of differential reddening by the lensing galaxy. The lens potential of SDSS J1216+3529 might be complicated by the presence of a secondary galaxy near the main lensing galaxy.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report the discovery of two doubly imaged quasars, SDSS J100128.61+502756.9 and SDSS J120629.65+433217.6, at redshifts of 1.838 and 1.789, and with image separations of 2.86" and 2.90", respectively. The objects were selected as lens candidates from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Based on the identical nature of the spectra of the two quasars in each pair and the identification of the lens galaxies, we conclude that the objects are gravitational lenses. The lenses are complicated; in both systems there are several galaxies in the fields very close to the quasars, in addition to the lens galaxies themselves. The lens modeling implies that these nearby galaxies contribute significantly to the lens potentials. On larger scales, we have detected an enhancement in the galaxy density near SDSS J100128.61+502756.9. The number of lenses with image separation of ~3" in the SDSS already exceeds the prediction of simple theoretical models based on the standard Lambda-dominated cosmology and observed velocity function of galaxies.</abstract>

        <abstract>We study the recently discovered gravitational lens SDSS J1004+4112, the first quasar lensed by a cluster of galaxies. It consists of four images with a maximum separation of 14.62\". The system was selected from the photometric data of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and has been confirmed as a lensed quasar at z=1.734 on the basis of deep imaging and spectroscopic follow-up observations. We present color-magnitude relations for galaxies near the lens plus spectroscopy of three central cluster members, which unambiguously confirm that a cluster at z=0.68 is responsible for the large image separation. We find a wide range of lens models consistent with the data, and despite considerable diversity they suggest four general conclusions: (1) the brightest cluster galaxy and the center of the cluster potential well appear to be offset by several kiloparsecs; (2) the cluster mass distribution must be elongated in the north-south direction, which is consistent with the observed distribution of cluster galaxies; (3) the inference of a large tidal shear (~0.2) suggests significant substructure in the cluster; and (4) enormous uncertainty in the predicted time delays between the images means that measuring the delays would greatly improve constraints on the models. We also compute the probability of such large-separation lensing in the SDSS quasar sample on the basis of the cold dark matter model. The lack of large-separation lenses in previous surveys and the discovery of one in SDSS together imply a mass fluctuation normalization sigma_8=1.0^+0.4_-0.2 (95% confidence) if cluster dark matter halos have an inner density profile rho~r^-1.5. Shallower profiles would require higher values of sigma_8. Although the statistical conclusion might be somewhat dependent on the degree of the complexity of the lens potential, the discovery of SDSS J1004+4112 is consistent with the predictions of the abundance of cluster-scale halos in the cold dark matter scenario.</abstract>

        <abstract>Cadenced optical imaging surveys in the next decade will be capable of detecting time-varying galaxy-scale strong gravitational lenses in large numbers, increasing the size of the statistically well-defined samples of multiply imaged quasars by two orders of magnitude, and discovering the first strongly lensed supernovae. We carry out a detailed calculation of the likely yields of several planned surveys, using realistic distributions for the lens and source properties and taking magnification bias and image configuration detectability into account. We find that upcoming wide-field synoptic surveys should detect several thousand lensed quasars. In particular, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) should find more than some 8000 lensed quasars, some 3000 of which will have well-measured time delays. The LSST should also find some 130 lensed supernovae during the 10-yr survey duration, which is compared with ~15 lensed supernovae predicted to be found by a deep, space-based supernova survey done by the Joint Dark Energy Mission. We compute the quad fraction in each survey, predicting it to be ~15 per cent for the lensed quasars and ~30 per cent for the lensed supernovae. Generating a mock catalogue of around 1500 well-observed double-image lenses, as could be derived from the LSST survey, we compute the available precision on the Hubble constant and the dark energy equation parameters for the time-delay distance experiment (assuming priors from Planck): the predicted marginalized 68 per cent confidence intervals are sigma(w_0) = 0.15, sigma(w_a) = 0.41 and sigma(h) = 0.017. While this is encouraging in the sense that these uncertainties are only 50 per cent larger than those predicted for a space-based Type Ia supernova sample, we show how the dark energy figure of merit degrades with decreasing knowledge of the lens mass distribution.</abstract>

        <abstract>We identify a third image in the unique quasar lens SDSS J1029+2623, the second known quasar lens produced by a massive cluster of galaxies. The spectrum of the third image shows similar emission and absorption features but has a redder continuum than the other two images, which can be explained by differential extinction or microlensing. We also identify several lensed arcs. Our observations suggest a complicated structure of the lens cluster at z~0.6. We argue that the three lensed images are produced by a naked cusp on the basis of successful mass models, the distribution of cluster member galaxies, and the shapes and locations of the lensed arcs. Lensing by a naked cusp is quite rare among galaxy-scale lenses but is predicted to be common among large-separation lensed quasars. Thus the discovery can be viewed as support for an important theoretical prediction of the standard cold dark matter model. Some of the data presented herein were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation.

        <abstract>We present Hubble Space Telescope (HST) ACS and WFC3 observations of SDSS J1029+2623, a three-image quasar lens system produced by a foreground cluster at z=0.584. Our strong lensing analysis reveals 6 additional multiply imaged galaxies. We confirm the complex nature of the mass distribution of the lensing cluster, with a bimodal distribution which deviates from the Chandra X-ray SB distribution. The Einstein radius is estimated to be \backslashtheta\_E=15.2'' \backslashpm 0.5'' for the quasar redshift of z=2.197. We derive a radial mass distribution from the combination of strong lensing, HST/ACS weak lensing, and Subaru/Suprime-cam weak lensing analysis results, finding a best-fit virial mass of M\_vir=(1.5+0.40-0.35) \backslashtimes 10^14 h^-1 M\_sun and a concentration parameter of c\_vir=25.7+14.1-7.5. The lensing mass estimate at the outer radius is smaller than the X-ray mass estimate by a factor of ~2. We ascribe this large mass discrepancy to shock heating of the intracluster gas during a merger, which is also suggested by the complex mass and gas distributions and the high value of the concentration parameter. In the HST image, we also identify a probable galaxy, GX, in the vicinity of the faintest quasar image C. The inclusion of GX explains the anomalous flux ratios between the quasar images. The morphology of the highly elongated quasar host galaxy is also well reproduced. The best-fit model suggests large total magnifications of 30 for the quasar and 35 for the quasar host galaxy, and has an AB time delay consistent with the measured value. (Abridged)</abstract>

        <abstract>Wide-field optical imaging surveys will contain tens of thousands of new strong gravitational lenses. Some of these will have new and unusual image configurations, and so will enable new applications: for example, systems with high image multiplicity will allow more detailed study of galaxy and group mass distributions, while high magnification is needed to super-resolve the faintest objects in the high-redshift universe. Inspired by a set of six unusual lens systems [including five selected from the Sloan Lens ACS survey (SLACS) and Strong Lens Legacy Survey (SL2S), plus the cluster Abell 1703], we consider several types of multi-component, physically motivated lens potentials, and use the ray-tracing code GLAMROC to predict exotic image configurations. We also investigate the effects of galaxy source profile and size, and use realistic sources to predict observable magnifications and estimate very approximate relative cross-sections. We find that lens galaxies with misaligned discs and bulges produce swallowtail and butterfly catastrophes, observable as 'broken' Einstein rings. Binary or merging galaxies show elliptic umbilic catastrophes, leading to an unusual Y-shaped configuration of four merging images. While not the maximum magnification configuration possible, it offers the possibility of mapping the local small-scale mass distribution. We estimate the approximate abundance of each of these exotic galaxy-scale lenses to be ~1 per all-sky survey. In higher mass systems, a wide range of caustic structures are expected, as already seen in many cluster lens systems. We interpret the central ring and its counter-image in Abell 1703 as a 'hyperbolic umbilic' configuration, with total magnification ~100 (depending on source size). The abundance of such configurations is also estimated to be ~1 per all-sky survey.</abstract>

Interesting objects for this study are found in strong gravitational lensing systems, where the foreground galaxies generate multiple images. &lt;BR /&gt;Aims: The reddening law of lensing galaxies is investigated by studying the colours of gravitationally-lensed quasars, and a handful of other quasars where a foreground galaxy is detected. &lt;BR /&gt;Methods: We compare the observed colours of quasars reported in the literature, with spectral templates reddened by different extinction laws and dust properties. The data consists of 21 quasar-galaxy systems, with a total of 48 images. The galaxies, which are both early- and late-type, have redshifts in the interval z = 0.04-1.51. &lt;BR /&gt;Results: We measure a difference in rest-frame B-V between the quasar images we study, and quasars without resolved foreground galaxies. This difference in colour is indicative of significant dust extinction in the intervening galaxy. Good fits to standard extinction laws were found for 22 of the images, corresponding to 13 different galaxies. Our fits imply a wide range of possible values for the total-to-selective extinction ratio, R_V. The distribution was found to be broad with a weighted mode of bar R_V = 2.4 and a FWHM of DeltaR\_V\ = 2.7 (sigma_R_V  1.1). Thus the bulk of the galaxies for which good reddening fits could be derived, have dust properties compatible with the Milky Way value (R_V=3.1).</abstract>

        <abstract>We present results from Chandra observations of SDSS J1004+4112, a strongly lensed quasar system with a maximum image separation of 15". All four bright images of the quasar, as well as resolved X-ray emission originating from the lensing cluster, are clearly detected. The emission from the lensing cluster extends out to approximately 1.5 arcmin. We measure the bolometric X-ray luminosity and temperature of the lensing cluster to be 4.7	imes10^44 ergs s^-1 and 6.4 keV, consistent with the luminosity-temperature relation for distant clusters. The mass estimated from the X-ray observation shows excellent agreement with the mass derived from gravitational lensing. The X-ray flux ratios of the quasar images differ markedly from the optical flux ratios, and the combined X-ray spectrum of the images possesses an unusually strong Fe Kalpha emission line, both of which are indicative of microlensing.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present results from Chandra observations of the cluster lens SDSS J1029+2623 at z _l=0.58, which is a gravitationally lensed quasar with the largest known image separation. We clearly detect X-ray emission both from the lensing cluster and the three lensed quasar images. The cluster has an X-ray temperature of kT = 8.1 (+2.0, -1.2) keV and bolometric luminosity of L _X = 9.6e44 erg s ^-1. Its surface brightness is centered near one of the brightest cluster galaxies, and it is elongated East-West. We identify a subpeak North-West of the main peak, which is suggestive of an ongoing merger. Even so, the X-ray mass inferred from the hydrostatic equilibrium assumption appears to be consistent with the lensing mass from the Einstein radius of the system. We find significant absorption in the soft X-ray spectrum of the faintest quasar image, which can be caused by an intervening material at either the lens or source redshift. The X-ray flux ratios between the quasar images (after correcting for absorption) are in reasonable agreement with those at optical and radio wavelengths, and all the flux ratios are inconsistent with those predicted by simple mass models. This implies that microlensing effect is not significant for this system and dark matter substructure is mainly responsible for the anomalous flux ratios.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present a simultaneous analysis of 18 galaxy lenses with time-delay measurements. For each lens, we derive mass maps using pixelated simultaneous modeling with shared Hubble constant. We estimate the Hubble constant to be 66^+6 _-4 km s^-1 Mpc^-1 (for a flat universe with Omega_ m  = 0.3, Omega_Lambda = 0.7). We have also selected a subsample of five relatively isolated early-type galaxies, and by simultaneous modeling with an additional constraint on isothermality of their mass profiles, we get H _0 = 76^+3 _-3 km s^-1 Mpc^-1.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present optical R-band light curves of five SDSS double QSOs (SDSS J0903+5028, SDSS J1001+5027, SDSS J1206+4332, SDSS J1353+1138, SDSS J1335+0118) obtained from monitoring at the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) between September 2005 and September 2007. We also present analytical and pixelated modeling of the observed systems. For SDSS J1206+4332, we measured the time delay to be Delta tau = 116^+ 4 _-5 days, which, for a singular isothermal ellipsoid model, corresponds to a Hubble constant of 73^+3_-4 km s^-1 Mpc^-1. Simultaneous pixelated modeling of five other systems for which a time delay has now been previously measured at the NOT leads to H_0 = 61.5^+8_-4 km s^-1 Mpc^-1. Finally, by comparing light curves of the two images of each system, suitably shifted by the predicted or observed time-delays, we found no evidence of microlensing variability over the course of the monitoring period.</abstract>

        <abstract>Evidence from the VLA, the newly enhanced MERLIN, and the European VLBI Network is presented which demonstrates that the strong flat-spectrum radio source B0218+35.7 is a gravitationally lensed system. It has two bright components separated by about 335 mas with similar radio spectra, fractional polarizations, and intrinsic position angles. Both components are compact on the mas scale while component A is elongated in a direction expected for a simple lens model. B0218+35.7 can be understood as a single lensing object of low ellipticity lying in front of the jet of a core-jet radio source. Observations of the system therefore may allow an estimate of H0 to be made.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present results from high-resolution VLBA observations of the gravitational lens system B0218+357, made at 15 GHz. These reveal clear differences in the shape and orientation of the structure of the background source seen in the two images. By comparing the properties of this structure in the images, we show how the laws of gravitational lensing are obeyed in this system, and investigate the A and B image relative magnification matrix. We show directly from these observations that the lens potential is non-spherical.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present the results of a visual search for galaxy-scale gravitational lenses in ~7 square degrees of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images. The dataset comprises the whole imaging data ever taken with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) in the filter F814W (I-band) up to August 31st, 2011, i.e. 6.03 square degrees excluding the field of the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS). In addition, we have searched for lenses in the whole Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) near-IR imaging dataset in all filters 1.01 square degree up to the same date. Our primary goal is to provide a sample of lenses with a broad range of different morphologies and lens-source brightness contrast in order to design and train future automated lens finders in view of all-sky surveys. Our criteria to select lenses are purely morphological as we do not use any color or redshift information. The final candidate selection is very conservative hence leading to a nearly pure but incomplete sample. We find 49 new lens candidates: 40 in the ACS images and 9 in the WFC3 images. Out of these, 16 candidates are secure lenses owe to their highly recognizable morphology, 21 more are very good candidates, and 12 more have morphologies compatible with gravitational lensing. The imaging dataset is heterogeneous in depth and spans a broad range of galactic latitudes. It is therefore insensitive to cosmic variance and allows to estimate the number of galaxy-scale strong lenses on the sky for a putative survey depth. Because of the incompleteness of the sample, the estimated lensing rates should be taken as lower limits. Using these, we anticipate that a 15000 square degrees space survey such as Euclid will find at least 60000 galaxy-scale strong lenses down to a limiting AB magnitude of I=24.5 (10-sigma) or I=25.8 (3-sigma).</abstract>

        <abstract>In the present-day universe, supermassive black hole masses (M_BH) appear to be strongly correlated with their galaxy's bulge luminosity, among other properties. In this study we explore the analogous relationship between M_BH, derived using the virial method, and the stellar R-band bulge luminosity (L_R) or stellar bulge mass (M_*) at epochs of 1&amp;lt;~z&amp;lt;~4.5, using a sample of 31 gravitationally lensed AGNs and 20 nonlensed AGNs. At redshifts z&amp;gt;1.7 (10-12 Gyr ago), we find that the observed M_BH-L_R relation is nearly the same (to within ~0.3 mag) as it is today. When the observed L_R are corrected for luminosity evolution, this means that the black holes grew in mass faster than their hosts, with the M_BH/M_* mass ratio being a factor of &amp;gt;~4^+2_-1 times larger at z&amp;gt;1.7 than it is today. By the redshift range 1&amp;lt;~z&amp;lt;~1.7 (8-10 Gyr ago), the M_BH/M_* ratio is at most 2 times higher than today, but it may be consistent with no evolution. Combining the results, we conclude that the ratio M_BH/M_* rises with look-back time, although it may saturate at ~6 times the local value. Scenarios in which moderately luminous quasar hosts at z&amp;gt;~1.7 were fully formed bulges that passively faded to the present epoch are ruled out. Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by AURA, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555.</abstract>

        <abstract>We have used spectra obtained with X-shooter, the triple arm optical-infrared spectrograph recently commissioned on the Very Large Telescope of the European Southern Observatory, to confirm the gravitational lens nature of the CAmbridge Sloan Survey Of Wide ARcs in the skY (CASSOWARY) candidate CSWA20. This system consists of a luminous red galaxy at redshift z_abs = 0.741, with a very high velocity dispersion, sigma_lens ~= 500kms^-1, which lenses a blue star-forming galaxy at z_em = 1.433 into four images with a mean separation of ~6arcsec. The source shares many of its properties with those of UV-selected galaxies at z = 2-3: it is forming stars at a rate SFR ~= 25M_solaryr^-1, has a metallicity of ~1/4 solar and shows nebular emission from two components separated by 0.4arcsec (in the image plane), possibly indicating a merger. It appears that foreground interstellar material within the galaxy has been evacuated from the sightline along which we observe the starburst, giving an unextinguished view of its stars and HII regions. CSWA20, with its massive lensing galaxy producing a high magnification of an intrinsically luminous background galaxy, is a promising target for future studies at a variety of wavelengths.

        <abstract>High-resolution MERLIN observations of a newly discovered four-image gravitational lens system, B0128+437, are presented. The system was found after a careful re-analysis of the entire CLASS data set. The MERLIN observations resolve four components in a characteristic quadruple-image configuration; the maximum image separation is 542mas and the total flux density is 48mJy at 5GHz. A best-fitting lens model with a singular isothermal ellipsoid results in large errors in the image positions. A significantly improved fit is obtained after the addition of a shear component, suggesting that the lensing system is more complex and may consist of multiple deflectors. The integrated radio spectrum of the background source indicates that it is a gigahertz peaked spectrum source. It may therefore be possible to resolve structure within the radio images with deep VLBI observations and thus to constrain the lensing mass distribution better.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report follow-up observations of two gravitational lens candidates identified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data set. We have confirmed that SDSS J102111.02+491330.4 is a previously unknown gravitationally lensed quasar. This lens system exhibits two images of a z=1.72 quasar, with an image separation of 1.14'Â±0.04'. Optical and near-IR imaging of the system reveals the presence of the lensing galaxy between the two quasar images. Observations of SDSS J112012.12+671116.0 indicate that it is more likely a binary quasar than a gravitational lens. This system has two quasars at a redshift of z=1.49, with an angular separation of 1.49'Â±0.02'. However, the two quasars have markedly different spectral energy distributions, and no lens galaxy is apparent in optical and near-IR images of this system. We also present a list of 31 SDSS lens candidates that follow-up observations have confirmed are not gravitational lenses. Observations reported here were obtained at the MMT Observatory, a joint facility of the University of Arizona and the Smithsonian Institution.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report the discovery of SDSS J115517.35+634622.0, a previously unknown gravitationally lensed quasar. The lens system exhibits two images of a z=2.89 quasar, with an image separation of 1.832"Â±0.007". Near-IR imaging of the system reveals the presence of the lensing galaxy between the two quasar images. Based on absorption features seen in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectrum, we determine a lens galaxy redshift of z=0.1756. The lens is rather unusual in that one of the quasar images is only 0.22"Â±0.07" (~0.1 R_eff) from the center of the lens galaxy, and photometric modeling indicates that this image is significantly brighter than predicted by a SIS model. This system was discovered in the course of an ongoing search for strongly lensed quasars in the data set from the SDSS.</abstract>

        <abstract>X-ray and optical observations of quadruply lensed quasars can provide a microarcsecond probe of the lensed quasar, corresponding to scale sizes of ~10^2-10^4 gravitational radii of the central black hole. This high angular resolution is achieved by taking advantage of microlensing by stars in the lensing galaxy. In this paper we use X-ray observations of 10 lensed quasars recorded with the Chandra X-Ray Observatory as well as corresponding optical data obtained with either the Hubble Space Telescope or ground-based optical telescopes. These are analyzed in a systematic and uniform way with emphasis on the flux ratio anomalies that are found relative to the predictions of smooth lens models. A comparison of the flux ratio anomalies between the X-ray and optical bands allows us to conclude that the optical emission regions of the lensed quasars are typically larger than expected from basic thin-disk models by factors of ~3-30. Based on observations obtained with the Magellan Consortium's Clay Telescope.</abstract>

        <abstract>We determine the most likely dark-matter fraction in the elliptical galaxy quadruply lensing the quasar PG 1115+080 based on analyses of the X-ray fluxes of the individual images in 2000 and 2008. Between the two epochs, the A _2 image of PG 1115+080 brightened relative to the other images by a factor of 6 in X-rays. We argue that the A _2 image had been highly demagnified in 2000 by stellar microlensing in the intervening galaxy and has recently crossed a caustic, thereby creating a new pair of microimages and brightening in the process. Over the same period, the A _2 image has brightened by a factor of only 1.2 in the optical. The most likely ratio of smooth material (dark matter) to clumpy material (stars) in the lensing galaxy to explain the observations is ~90\% of the matter in a smooth dark-matter component and ~10\% in stars.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report the new spectroscopic observations of the gravitational lens RXJ 021+4529 with the multi-mode focal reducer SCORPIO of the SAO RAS 6 m telescope. The new spectral observations were compared with the previously observed spectra of components A and B of RXJ 0921+4529, i.e., the same components observed in different epochs. We found a significant difference in the spectrum between the components that cannot be explained with microlensing and/or spectral variation. We conclude that RXJ 0921+4529 is a binary quasar system, where redshifts of quasars A and B are 1.6535 Â± 0.0005 and 1.6625 Â± 0.0015, respectively.</abstract>

        <abstract>The authors present radio observations of the source 1830-211 whose structure is anomalous in relation to its spectrum. The flat-spectrum source has well-defined double structure with components of nearly equal flux densities and separated by \equiv1 arcsec. The source does not fit into any of the known classes. It is possible that the double structure is due to gravitational lensing of a single flat-spectrum source by the potential of a foreground galaxy, but even this does not fully explain all the observations.</abstract>

        <abstract>A total of 10 good candidates for gravitational lensing have been discovered in the WFPC2 images from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Medium Deep Survey (MDS) and archival primary observations. These candidate lenses are unique HST discoveries, i.e., they are faint systems with subarcsecond separations between the lensing objects and the lensed source images. Most of them are difficult objects for ground-based spectroscopic confirmation or for measurement of the lens and source redshifts. Seven are ''strong lens'' candidates that appear to have multiple images of the source. Three are cases in which the single image of the source galaxy has been significantly distorted into an arc. The first two quadruply lensed candidates were reported by Ratnatunga et al. We report on the subsequent eight candidates and describe them with simple models based on the assumption of singular isothermal potentials. Residuals from the simple models for some of the candidates indicate that a more complex model for the potential will probably be required to explain the full structural detail of the observations once they are confirmed to be lenses. We also discuss the effective survey area that was searched for these candidate lens objects.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report the serendipitous discovery of ''Einstein cross'' gravitational lens candidates using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We have so far discovered two good examples of such lenses, each in the form of four faint blue images located in a symmetric configuration around a red elliptical galaxy. The high resolution of HST has facilitated the discovery of this optically selected sample of faint lenses with small (~1'') separations between the (I ~ 25--27) lensed components and the much brighter (I ~ 19--22) lensing galaxies. The sample has been discovered in the routine processing of HST fields through the Medium Deep Survey pipeline, which fits simple galaxy models to broadband filter images of all objects detected in random survey fields using WFPC2. We show that the lens configuration can be modeled using the gravitational field potential of a singular isothermal ellipsoidal mass distribution. With this model the lensing potential is very similar, both in ellipticity and orientation, to the observed light distribution of the elliptical galaxy, as would occur when stars are a tracer population. The model parameters and associated errors have been derived by two-dimensional analysis of the observed images. The maximum likelihood procedure iteratively converges simultaneously on the model for the lensing elliptical galaxy and the source of the lensed components. A systematic search is in progress for other gravitational lens candidates in the HST Medium Deep Survey. This should eventually lead to a good statistical estimate for lensing probabilities and enable us to probe the cosmological parameters.</abstract>

        <abstract>We announce the probable discovery of a new very bright gravitationally lensed QSO, &lt;ASTROBJ&gt;HS 0810+2554&lt;/ASTROBJ&gt; (z=1.50, V=15.3). The gravitational lens character has been discovered serendipitously by means of short (12 times 1 s) HST/STIS target acquisition images. The coadded images show a close bright double A (V=16.0) and B (16.7) separated by 0.25 arcsec plus two fainter images C (17.4) and D (18.8). There is also evidence for a lens galaxy in the center of the images which is fainter than A by a factor of le 30 at 7150 \AA. The image configuration resembles very much that of &lt;ASTROBJ&gt;PG 1115+080&lt;/ASTROBJ&gt; except that in HS 0810+2554 image splittings (&amp;lt;=1'') are smaller by a factor of ~ 2.5 and HS 0810+2554 is brighter by ~ 1^m\.

We find K'= 17.1Â±0.1 and r = 23.9Â±0.2, making it a very red source with (r-K') = 6.8Â±0.25. We also observed in Thuan-Gunn g band (0.49 micron) and found g &amp;gt; 24.5 at the 90% confidence level. We interpret our observations as a reddened gravitational lens on the basis of its optical-IR color and positional coincidence with the radio source.</abstract>

        <abstract>We have carried out an extensive spectroscopic survey with the Keck and VLT telescopes, targeting lensed galaxies in the background of the massive cluster Abell 68. Spectroscopic measurements are obtained for 26 lensed images, including a distant galaxy at z=5.4. Redshifts have been determined for 5 out of 7 multiple-image systems. Through a careful modeling of the mass distribution in the strongly lensed regime, we derive a mass estimate of 5.3\times10^14 M_solar within 500 kpc. Our mass model is then used to constrain the redshift distribution of the remaining multiply imaged and singly imaged sources. This enables us to examine the physical properties for a subsample of 7 Lyalpha emitters at 1.7&amp;lt;~z&amp;lt;~5.5, whose unlensed luminosities of ~=10^41 ergs s^-1 are fainter than similar objects found in blank fields. Of particular interest is an extended Lyalpha emission region surrounding a highly magnified source at z=2.6, detected in VIMOS integral field spectroscopy data. The physical scale of the most distant lensed source at z=5.4 is very small (&amp;lt;300 pc), similar to the lensed z~5.6 emitter reported by Ellis et al. in Abell 2218. New photometric data available for Abell 2218 allow for a direct comparison between these two unique objects. Our survey illustrates the practicality of using lensing clusters to probe the faint end of the z~2-5 Lyalpha luminosity function in a manner that is complementary to blank-field narrowband surveys. Data presented herein were obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The Observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation.

        <abstract>We present a strong lensing analysis of the galaxy cluster Abell 370 (z = 0.375) based on the recent multicolour images by Advanced Camera for Surveys obtained as part of the Early Release Observation (ERO) that followed the Hubble Service Mission #4. Back in 1987, the giant gravitational arc (z = 0.725) in Abell 370 was one of the first pieces of evidence that massive clusters are dense enough to act as strong gravitational lenses. The new observations reveal in detail its disclike morphology, and we show that it can be interpreted as a complex five-image configuration, with a total magnification factor of 32 Â± 4. Moreover, the high-resolution multicolour information allowed us to identify 10 multiply imaged background galaxies. We derive a mean Einstein radius of thetas_E = 39 Â± 2 arcsec for a source redshift at z = 2, corresponding to a mass of M(&amp;lt;thetas_E) = 2.82 Â± 0.15 	imes 10^14M_solar and M(&amp;lt;250 kpc) = 3.8 Â± 0.2 	imes 10^14M_solar, in good agreement with Subaru weak-lensing measurements. The typical mass model error is smaller than 5 per cent, a factor of 3 of improvement compared to the previous lensing analysis. Abell 370 mass distribution is confirmed to be bimodal with very small offset between the dark matter, the X-ray gas and the stellar mass. Combining this information with the velocity distribution reveals that Abell 370 is likely the merging of two equally massive clusters along the line of sight, explaining the very high-mass density necessary to efficiently produce strong lensing. These new observations stress the importance of multicolour imaging for the identification of multiple images which is key to determining an accurate mass model. The very large Einstein radius makes Abell 370 one of the best clusters to search for high-redshift galaxies through strong magnification in the central region.</abstract>

        <abstract>Context: Strong gravitational lensing is a unique tool that can be used to accurately model the inner mass distribution of massive galaxy clusters. In particular, clusters with large Einstein radii provide a wealth of multiply imaged systems in the cluster core. Measuring the redshift of these multiple images provides strong constraints for precisely determining the shape of the central dark matter profile. &lt;BR /&gt;Aims: This paper presents a spectroscopic survey of strongly lensed galaxies in the massive cluster lens Abell 1703, which displays a large Einstein radius (28acuteacute at z=2.8) and numerous strongly-lensed systems including a central ring-like configuration. &lt;BR /&gt;Methods: We used the LRIS spectrograph on Keck to target multiple images and lensed galaxy candidates, and used the measured spectroscopic redshifts to constrain the mass distribution of the cluster using a parametric model. &lt;BR /&gt;Results: The spectroscopic data enable us to measure accurate redshifts for 7 sources at z&amp;gt;2 , all of which are in good agreement with their photometric redshifts. We update the identification of multiply imaged systems by discovering 3 new systems and identifying a radial counter image. We also report the discovery of a remarkably bright ~3.6 L^* i-band dropout at z=5.827 in our mask and it is only moderately magnified by the cluster (mu	ilde3.0Â±0.08). The improved parametric mass model, including 16 multiple systems with 10 spectroscopic redshifts, further constrains the smooth cluster-scale mass distribution with a generalized NFW profile of best-fit logarithmic slope alpha=0.92Â±0.04, concentration c_200=4.72Â±0.40 and scale radius r_s =476Â±45 kpc. The overall rms in the image plane is 1.3acuteacute.  &lt;BR /&gt;Conclusions: Our strong-lensing model allows us to predict a large-scale shear signal that is consistent with weak-lensing measurements inferred from Subaru data out to 4 Mpc h^-1. Also considering the strong-lensing modeling requires a single dark matter clump, this suggests that Abell 1703 is a relaxed, unimodal cluster. This unique cluster could be probed further using deep X-ray, SZ, and dynamics analysis for a detailed study of the physics in a relaxed cluster.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present seven epochs of spectroscopy on the quadruply imaged quasar SDSS J1004+4112, spanning observed-frame time delays from 1 to 322 days. The spectra reveal differences in the emission lines between the lensed images. Specifically, component A showed a strong enhancement in the blue wings of several high-ionization lines relative to component B, which lasted at least 28 days (observed frame) and then faded. Since the predicted time delay between A and B is &amp;lt;~30 days, our time coverage suggests that the event was not intrinsic to the quasar. We attribute these variations to microlensing of part of the broad emission line region of the quasar, apparently resolving structure in the source plane on a scale of ~10^16 cm at z=1.734. In addition, we observed smaller differences in the emission-line profiles between components A and B that persisted throughout the time span, which may also be due to microlensing or millilensing. Further spectroscopic monitoring of this system holds considerable promise for resolving the structure of the broad emission line region in quasars.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present high-resolution (0.3'') Very Large Array imaging of the molecular gas in the host galaxy of the high-redshift quasar PSS J2322+1944 (z=4.12). These observations confirm that the molecular gas (CO) in the host galaxy of this quasar is lensed into a full Einstein ring and reveal the internal gas dynamics in this system. The ring has a diameter of ~1.5'' and thus is sampled over ~20 resolution elements by our observations. Through a model-based lens inversion, we recover the velocity gradient of the molecular reservoir in the quasar host galaxy of PSS J2322+1944. The Einstein ring lens configuration enables us to zoom in on the emission and to resolve scales down to &amp;lt;~1 kpc. From the model-reconstructed source, we find that the molecular gas is distributed on a scale of 5 kpc and has a total mass of M(H_2)=1.7\times10^10 M_solar. A basic estimate of the dynamical mass gives M_dyn=4.4\times10^10sin-2i M_solar, that is, only ~2.5 times the molecular gas mass and ~30 times the black hole mass (assuming that the dynamical structure is highly inclined). The lens configuration also allows us to tie the optical emission to the molecular gas emission, which suggests that the active galactic nucleus does reside within, but not close to the center of, the molecular reservoir. Together with the (at least partially) disturbed structure of the CO, this suggests that the system is interacting. Such interaction, possibly caused by a major ''wet'' merger, may be responsible for both feeding the quasar and fueling the massive starburst of 680 M_solar yr^-1 in this system, in agreement with recently suggested scenarios of quasar activity and galaxy assembly in the early universe.</abstract>

        <abstract>Astronomical instruments generally possess spatially variant point-spread functions, which determine the amount by which an image pixel is blurred as a function of position. Several techniques have been devised to handle this variability in the context of the standard image deconvolution problem. We have developed an iterative gravitational lens modeling code called Mirage that determines the parameters of pixelated source intensity distributions for a given lens model. We are able to include the effects of spatially variant point-spread functions using the iterative procedures in this lensing code. In this paper, we discuss the methods to include spatially variant blurring effects and test the results of the algorithm in the context of gravitational lens modeling problems.</abstract>

        <abstract>Strong gravitational lensing of an extended object is described by a mapping from source to image coordinates that is nonlinear and cannot generally be inverted analytically. Determining the structure of the source intensity distribution also requires a description of the blurring effect due to a point-spread function. This initial study uses an iterative gravitational lens modeling scheme based on the semilinear method to determine the linear parameters (source intensity profile) of a strongly lensed system. Our \"matrix-free\" approach avoids construction of the lens and blurring operators while retaining the least-squares formulation of the problem. The parameters of an analytical lens model are found through nonlinear optimization by an advanced genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimizer (PSO). These global optimization routines are designed to explore the parameter space thoroughly, mapping model degeneracies in detail. We develop a novel method that determines the L-curve for each solution automatically, which represents the trade-off between the image chi^2 and regularization effects, and allows an estimate of the optimally regularized solution for each lens parameter set. In the final step of the optimization procedure, the lens model with the lowest chi^2 is used while the global optimizer solves for the source intensity distribution directly. This allows us to accurately determine the number of degrees of freedom in the problem to facilitate comparison between lens models and enforce positivity on the source profile. In practice, we find that the GA conducts a more thorough search of the parameter space than the PSO.</abstract>

        <abstract>We observed the quadruple gravitationally lensed image of MG J0414+0534 on 23 November 1997 with a global VLBI array at 8.4 GHz. We report wide-field imaging results of its four components at submilliarcsecond resolution, displaying complex core-like and jet-like extended structures. A simple model combining a singular isothermal ellipsoid to represent the main lens galaxy, external shear, and a singular isothermal sphere to represent an additional, nearby object accounts well for the core positions and flux densities of the VLBI images. This model predicts delays between the different lensed images of several weeks.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present a joint gravitational lensing and stellar-dynamical analysis of 11 early-type galaxies (median deflector redshift z_d = 0.5) from Strong Lenses in the Legacy Survey (SL2S). Using newly measured redshifts and stellar velocity dispersions from Keck spectroscopy with lens models from Paper I, we derive the total mass-density slope inside the Einstein radius for each of the 11 lenses. The average total density slope is found to be &lt;gamma'&gt; = 2.16^+0.09_-0.09 (rho_tot ~ r^-gamma'), with an intrinsic scatter of 0.25^+0.10_-0.07. We also determine the dark matter fraction for each lens within half the effective radius, R_eff/2, and find the average-projected dark matter mass fraction to be 0.42^+0.08_-0.08 with a scatter of 0.20^+0.09_-0.07 for a Salpeter initial mass function. By combining the SL2S results with those from the Sloan Lens ACS Survey (median z_d = 0.2) and the Lenses Structure and Dynamics Survey (median z_d = 0.8), we investigate cosmic evolution of gamma' and find a mild trend partial_&lt;gamma'&gt;/partial_z_d = -0.25^+0.10_-0.12. This suggests that the total density profile of massive galaxies has become slightly steeper over cosmic time. If this result is confirmed by larger samples, it would indicate that dissipative processes played some role in the growth of massive galaxies since z ~ 1.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report the discovery of a new two-image gravitational lens system, CLASS B2319+051, from the Cosmic Lens All-Sky Survey. Radio imaging with the Very Large Array (VLA) and Multielement Radio-linked Interferometer Network (MERLIN) shows two compact components with a flux density ratio of ~=5:1, separated by 1.36". Observations with the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) resolve each of the radio components into a pair of parity-reversed subcomponents. Hubble Space Telescope observations with the Near-Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) show a bright elliptical galaxy (G1) coincident with the radio position, and a second irregular galaxy (G2) 3.4" to the northwest. Previous spectroscopic studies have indicated that these galaxies are at different redshifts (z_G1=0.624, z_G2=0.588). Infrared counterparts to the lensed radio components are not detected in the NICMOS image, and the source redshift has not yet been determined. Preliminary mass modeling based on the VLBA subcomponent data indicates that the lensing potential includes a strong external shear contribution. A VLA monitoring program is currently being undertaken to measure the differential time delay.</abstract>

Based on the milliarcsecond-scale substructure of the lensed radio components and precise optical astrometry for the lensing galaxy, we construct models for the system and place constraints on the galaxy mass profile. For a single galaxy model with surface mass density , we find that at 2sigma confidence. Including a second deflector to represent a possible satellite galaxy of the primary lens leads to slightly steeper mass profiles.</abstract>

        <abstract>The quasar SDSS J133401.39+331534.3 at z = 2.426 is found to be a two-image gravitationally lensed quasar with an image separation of 0farcs833. The object is first identified as a lensed quasar candidate in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Quasar Lens Search, and then confirmed as a lensed system from follow-up observations at the Subaru and University of Hawaii 2.2 m telescopes. We estimate the redshift of the lensing galaxy to be 0.557 based on absorption lines in the quasar spectra as well as the color of the galaxy. In particular, we observe the system with the Subaru Telescope AO188 adaptive optics with a laser guide star, in order to derive accurate astrometry, which well demonstrates the usefulness of the laser guide star adaptive optics imaging for studying strong lens systems. Our mass modeling with improved astrometry implies that a nearby bright galaxy ~4' apart from the lensing galaxy is likely to affect the lens potential. Based on data collected at the Subaru Telescope, which is operated by the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan. Use of the UH2.2 m telescope for the observations is supported by NAOJ.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report the discovery of a pair of quasars at z=1.487, with a separation of 8\farcs585Â±0\farcs002. Subaru Telescope infrared imaging reveals the presence of an elliptical and a disk-like galaxy located almost symmetrically between the quasars, creating a cross-like configuration. Based on absorption lines in the quasar spectra and the colors of the galaxies, we estimate that both galaxies are located at redshift z=0.899. This, as well as the similarity of the quasar spectra, suggests that the system is a single quasar multiply imaged by a galaxy group or cluster acting as a gravitational lens, although the possibility of a binary quasar cannot be fully excluded. We show that the gravitational lensing hypothesis implies these galaxies are not isolated, but must be embedded in a dark matter halo of virial mass ~ 4 \times 10^14 h_70^-1 M_\odot assuming an NFW model with a concentration parameter of c_vir=6, or a singular isothermal sphere profile with a velocity dispersion of ~ 670 km s^-1. We place constraints on the location of the dark matter halo, as well as the velocity dispersions of the galaxies. In addition, we discuss the influence of differential reddening, microlensing and intrinsic variability on the quasar spectra and broadband photometry.</abstract>

        <abstract>Aims.To predict time delays for a sample of gravitationally lensed quasars and to evaluate the accuracy that can be realistically achieved on the value of H_0.&lt;BR /&gt; Methods: .We consider 14 lensed quasars that are candidates for time-delay monitoring and model them in detail using pixelized lens models. For each system, we provide a mass map, arrival-time surface and the distribution of predicted time-delays in a concordance cosmology, assuming H_0^-1=14 Gyr (H_0=70 in local units). Based on the predicted time-delays and on the observational circumstances, we rate each lens as "excellent" or "good" or "unpromising" for time-delay monitoring. Finally, we analyze simulated time delays for the 11 lens rated excellent or good, and show that H_0 can be recovered to a precision of 5\%.&lt;BR /&gt; Results: .In combination with COSMOGRAIL Paper I on the temporal sampling of lensed quasar light curves, the present work will help to optimize the strategy of the monitoring campaigns of lensed quasars.&lt;BR /&gt;</abstract>

        <abstract>In the galaxy clusters SSDS J1004+411 and ACO 1689, a large number of multiply imaged background objects have recently been observed. We use these data to map the projected mass distribution in the inner regions of these clusters. The source redshifts in these clusters span a large range, which eliminates the degeneracies that plague nearly all lensing work. As a result, the mass maps are very well constrained, despite very weak prior assumptions. ACO 1689 lenses so many objects that we can afford to map it twice using disjoint sets of images, thus verifying our internal error estimates. We then deproject the mass maps (pretending for this purpose that they are spherical) and obtain inner profiles consistent with rho~r^-1 and indistinguishable from recent cold dark matter simulations. Assuming that baryons make only a small difference to the profile outside ~10 kpc, these results support the prediction of a universal inner profile for dark matter structures, independent of any parameterization of that profile.</abstract>

        <abstract>We show that some characteristics of multiply imaged QSO systems are very model independent and can be deduced accurately by simply scrutinizing the relative positions of images and galaxy/lens center. These include the time-ordering of the images, the orientation of the lens potential, and the rough morphology of any ring. Other features can differ considerably between specific models; H_0 is an example. Surprisingly, properties inherited from a circularly symmetric lens system are model dependent, whereas features that arise from the breaking of circular symmetry are model independent. We first develop these results from some abstract geometric ideas, then illustrate them for some well-known systems (the quadruples Q2237+030, H1413+117, HST 14113+5211, PG 1115+080, MG 0414+0534, B1608+656, B1422+231, and RX J0911+0551 and the 10-image system B1933+507), and finally remark on two systems (B1359+154 and PMN J0134-0931) where the lens properties are more complex. We also introduce a Java applet that produces simple lens systems and helps further illustrate the concepts.</abstract>

        <abstract>In gravitational lensing, steeper mass profiles generically produce longer time delays but smaller magnifications, without necessarily changing the image positions or magnification ratios between different images. This is well known. We find in this paper, however, that even if steepness is fixed, time delays can still have significant model dependence, which we attribute to shape-modeling degeneracies. This conclusion follows from numerical experiments with models of 35 galaxy lenses. We suggest that varying and twisting ellipticities, features that are explored by pixelated lens models but not, so far, by parametric models, has an important effect on time delays.</abstract>

        <abstract>The discovery of a gravitational lens candidate is reported. The quasars SDSS J111611.73+411821.5 and SDSS J111610.68+411814.4 are recognized as two images of the same object, being strongly lensed by the closer galaxy SDSS J111611.03+411820.9. The source is located at a redshift of z~3, while the redshift of the lens galaxy is z~0.25. The separation of the images is large,~13 arcsec. Commonly used models of the mass distribution for the lens galaxy with values of the parameters in the expected range describe the positions and fluxes of the images.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present the results of a systematic search for gravitationally lensed arcs in clusters of galaxies located in the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 data archive. By carefully examining the images of 128 clusters we have located 12 candidate radial arcs and 104 tangential arcs, each of whose length-to-width ratio exceeds 7. In addition, 24 other radial arc candidates were identified with a length-to-width ratio of less than 7. Keck spectroscopy of 17 candidate radial arcs suggests that contamination of the radial arc sample from nonlensed objects is \~30\\%-50\\%. With our catalog, we explore the practicality of using the number ratio of radial to tangential arcs as a statistical measure of the slope \beta of the dark matter distribution in cluster cores (where \rho_DM\~r^-beta at small radii). Despite the heterogeneous nature of the cluster sample, we demonstrate that this abundance ratio is fairly constant across various cluster subsamples partitioned according to X-ray luminosity and optical survey depth. We develop the necessary formalism to interpret this ratio in the context of two-component mass models for cluster cores. Although the arc statistics in our survey are consistent with a range of density profiles-\beta\&amp;lt;\~1.6 depending on various assumptions-we show that one of the prime limiting factors is the distribution of stellar masses for the brightest cluster galaxies. We discuss the prospects for improving the observational constraints and thereby providing a reliable statistical constraint on cluster dark matter profiles on \&amp;lt;\~100 kpc scales.</abstract>

        <abstract>This study explores the space density and properties of active galaxies to z~=0.8. We have investigated the frequency and nature of unresolved nuclei in galaxies at moderate redshift as indicators of nuclear activity such as active galactic nuclei (AGNs) or starbursts. Candidates are selected by fitting imaged galaxies with multicomponent models using maximum likelihood estimate techniques to determine the best model fit. We select those galaxies requiring an unresolved, point-source component in the galaxy nucleus, in addition to a disk and/or bulge component, to adequately model the galaxy light. We have searched 70 WFPC2 images primarily from the Medium Deep Survey for galaxies containing compact nuclei. In our survey of 1033 galaxies, the fraction containing an unresolved nuclear component &amp;gt;=3\% of the total galaxy light is 16\%Â±3\% corrected for incompleteness and 9\%Â±1\% for nuclei &amp;gt;=5\% of the galaxy light. Spectroscopic redshifts have been obtained for 35 of our AGN/starburst candidates, and photometric redshifts are estimated to an accuracy of sigma\_z~=0.1 for the remaining sample. In this paper, the first of two for this study, we present the selected Hubble Space Telescope imaged galaxies having unresolved nuclei and discuss the selection procedure. We also present the ground-based spectroscopy for these galaxies as well as the photometric redshift predictions for those galaxies without spectra.</abstract>

        <abstract>The V = 16.9 quasar FBQ 0951+2635 at redshift z = 1.24 appears double on CCD exposures taken in subarcsecond seeing. The two objects are separated by 1.1'' and differ in brightness by 0.9 mag. VLA observations show the radio source to be double with the same separation and position angle. Spectra taken with the Keck II Telescope show the two components to have nearly identical emission-line spectra, but with somewhat different absorption-line systems. Subtraction of two stellar point-spread functions from the pair of components consistently leaves a residual object. Depending upon whether this third object is extended or a point source, it may be as much as 1/10 or as little as 1/100 as bright as the brighter QSO component. The observations leave little doubt that the two brighter objects are gravitationally lensed images of the same quasar. The third object might be either the lensing galaxy or a third image of the quasar, but both interpretations have serious shortcomings. Observations reported in this paper were obtained in part at the MDM Observatory, a facility jointly operated by the University of Michigan, Dartmouth College, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present the fifth edition of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Quasar Catalog, which is based upon the SDSS Seventh Data Release. The catalog, which contains 105,783 spectroscopically confirmed quasars, represents the conclusion of the SDSS-I and SDSS-II quasar survey. The catalog consists of the SDSS objects that have luminosities larger than M_i = -22.0 (in a cosmology with H _0 = 70 km s^-1 Mpc^-1, Omega_ M  = 0.3, and Omega_Lambda = 0.7), have at least one emission line with FWHM larger than 1000 km s^-1 or have interesting/complex absorption features, are fainter than i ap 15.0, and have highly reliable redshifts. The catalog covers an area of ap9380 deg^2. The quasar redshifts range from 0.065 to 5.46, with a median value of 1.49; the catalog includes 1248 quasars at redshifts greater than 4, of which 56 are at redshifts greater than 5. The catalog contains 9210 quasars with i &amp;lt; 18; slightly over half of the entries have i &amp;lt; 19. For each object the catalog presents positions accurate to better than 0farcs1 rms per coordinate, five-band (ugriz) CCD-based photometry with typical accuracy of 0.03 mag, and information on the morphology and selection method. The catalog also contains radio, near-infrared, and X-ray emission properties of the quasars, when available, from other large-area surveys. The calibrated digital spectra cover the wavelength region 3800-9200 AA at a spectral resolution of ~= 2000; the spectra can be retrieved from the SDSS public database using the information provided in the catalog. Over 96\% of the objects in the catalog were discovered by the SDSS. We also include a supplemental list of an additional 207 quasars with SDSS spectra whose archive photometric information is incomplete.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report on the redshift measurement and CO line excitation of HERMES J105751.1+573027 (HLSW-01), a strongly lensed submillimeter galaxy discovered in Herschel/SPIRE observations as part of the Herschel Multi-tiered Extragalactic Survey (HerMES). HLSW-01 is an ultra-luminous galaxy with an intrinsic far-infrared luminosity of L FIR = 1.4 Ã 1013 L sun, and is lensed by a massive group of galaxies into at least four images with a total magnification of mu = 10.9 Â± 0.7. With the 100 GHz instantaneous bandwidth of the Z-Spec instrument on the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory, we robustly identify a redshift of z = 2.958 Â± 0.007 for this source, using the simultaneous detection of four CO emission lines (J = 7 &amp;#8594; 6, J = 8 &amp;#8594; 7, J = 9 &amp;#8594; 8, and J = 10 &amp;#8594; 9). Combining the measured line fluxes for these high-J transitions with the J = 1 &amp;#8594; 0, J = 3 &amp;#8594; 2, and J = 5 &amp;#8594; 4 line fluxes measured with the Green Bank Telescope, the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter Astronomy, and the Plateau de Bure Interferometer, respectively, we model the physical properties of the molecular gas in this galaxy. We find that the full CO spectral line energy distribution is described well by warm, moderate-density gas with T kin = 86-235 K and n_H_2 = (1.1--3.5)\\times 10^3 cm-3. However, it is possible that the highest-J transitions are tracing a small fraction of very dense gas in molecular cloud cores, and two-component models that include a warm/dense molecular gas phase with T kin ~ 200 K, n_H_2 \\sim 10^5 cm-3 are also consistent with these data. Higher signal-to-noise measurements of the J up &gt;= 7 transitions with high spectral resolution, combined with high spatial resolution CO maps, are needed to improve our understanding of the gas excitation, morphology, and dynamics of this interesting high-redshift galaxy.</abstract>

        <abstract>We have identified three multiply imaged galaxies in Hubble Space Telescope images of the redshift z=0.68 cluster responsible for the large-separation quadruply lensed quasar, SDSS J1004+4112. Spectroscopic redshifts have been secured for two of these systems using the Keck I 10 m telescope. The most distant lensed galaxy, at z=3.332, forms at least four images, and an Einstein ring encompassing 3.1 times more area than the Einstein ring of the lensed QSO images at z=1.74, due to the greater source distance. For a second multiply imaged galaxy, we identify Lyalpha emission at a redshift of z=2.74. The cluster mass profile can be constrained from near the center of the brightest cluster galaxy, where we observe both a radial arc and the fifth image of the lensed quasar, to the Einstein radius of the highest redshift galaxy, ~110 kpc. Our preliminary modeling indicates that the mass approximates an elliptical body, with an average projected logarithmic gradient of ~=-0.5. The system is potentially useful for a direct measurement of world models in a previously untested redshift range. Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present the first result of a survey for strong galaxy-galaxy lenses in Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) images. SDSS J082728.70+223256.4 was selected as a lensing candidate using selection criteria based on the color and positions of objects in the SDSS photometric catalog. Follow-up imaging and spectroscopy showed this object to be a lensing system. The lensing galaxy is elliptical at z = 0.349 in a galaxy cluster. The lensed galaxy has the spectrum of a post-starburst galaxy at z = 0.766. The lensing galaxy has an estimated mass of ~1.2 \times 10^12 M_sun , and the corresponding mass-to-light ratio in the B-band is ~26M _sun/L _sun inside 1.1 effective radii of the lensing galaxy. Our study shows how catalogs drawn from multi-band surveys can be used to find strong galaxy-galaxy lenses having multiple lens images. Our strong lensing candidate selection based on photometry-only catalogs will be useful in future multi-band imaging surveys such as SNAP and LSST.</abstract>

        <abstract>We introduce the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) Emission-Line Lens Survey GALaxy-Ly\alpha EmitteR sYstems (BELLS GALLERY) Survey, which is a Hubble Space Telescope program to image a sample of galaxy-scale strong gravitational lens candidate systems with high-redshift Ly\alpha emitters (LAEs) as the background sources. The goal of the BELLS GALLERY Survey is to illuminate dark substructures in galaxy-scale halos by exploiting the small-scale clumpiness of rest-frame far-UV emission in lensed LAEs, and to thereby constrain the slope and normalization of the substructure-mass function. In this paper, we describe in detail the spectroscopic strong-lens selection technique, which is based on methods adopted in the previous Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) Survey, BELLS, and SLACS for the Masses Survey. We present the BELLS GALLERY sample of the 21 highest-quality galaxy\\ndashLAE candidates selected from \\ap 1.4\\times \\10\\^6 galaxy spectra in the BOSS of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III. These systems consist of massive galaxies at redshifts of approximately 0.5 strongly lensing LAEs at redshifts from 2\\ndash3. The compact nature of LAEs makes them an ideal probe of dark substructures, with a substructure-mass sensitivity that is unprecedented in other optical strong-lens samples. The magnification effect from lensing will also reveal the structure of LAEs below 100 pc scales, providing a detailed look at the sites of the most concentrated unobscured star formation in the universe. The source code used for candidate selection is available for download as a part of this release.</abstract>

        <abstract>Gravitationally lensed quasars can be used as powerful cosmological and astrophysical probes. We can (i) infer the Hubble constant H_0 based on the so-called time-delay technique, (ii) unveil substructures along the line-of-sight toward distant galaxies, and (iii) compare the shape and the slope of baryons and dark matter distributions in the inner regions of galaxies. To reach these goals, we need high-accuracy astrometry of the quasar images relative to the lensing galaxy and morphology measurements of the lens. In this work, we first present new astrometry for 11 lenses with measured time delays, namely, JVAS B0218+357, SBS 0909+532, RX J0911.4+0551, FBQS J0951+2635, HE 1104-1805, PG 1115+080, JVAS B1422+231, SBS 1520+530, CLASS B1600+434, CLASS B1608+656, and HE 2149-2745. These measurements proceed from the use of the Magain-Courbin-Sohy (MCS) deconvolution algorithm applied in an iterative way (ISMCS) to near-IR HST images. We obtain a typical astrometric accuracy of about 1-2.5 mas and an accurate shape measurement of the lens galaxy. Second, we combined these measurements with those of 14 other lensing systems, mostly from the COSMOGRAIL set of targets, to present new mass models of these lenses. The modeling of these 25 gravitational lenses led to the following results: 1) in four double-image quasars (HE0047-1746, J1226-006, SBS 1520+530, and HE 2149-2745), we show that the influence of the lens environment on the time delay can easily be quantified and modeled, hence putting these lenses with high priority for time-delay determination; 2) for quadruple-image quasars, the difficulty often encountered in reproducing the image positions to milli-arcsec accuracy (astrometric anomaly problem) is overcome by explicitly including the nearest visible galaxy/satellite in the lens model. However, one anomalous system (RXS J1131-1231) does not show any luminous perturber in its vicinity, and three others (WFI 2026-4536, WFI 2033-4723, and B2045+265) have problematic modeling. These four systems are the best candidates for a pertubation by a dark matter substructure along the line-of-sight; 3) we revisit the correlation between the position angle (PA) and ellipticity of the light and of the mass distribution in lensing galaxies. As in previous studies, we find a significant correlation between the PA of the light and of the mass distributions. However, in contrast with these same studies, we find that the ellipticity of the light and of the mass also correlate well, suggesting that the overall spatial distribution of matter is not very different from the baryon distribution in the inner ~5 kpc of lensing galaxies. This offers a new test for high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations.

        <abstract>Aims.RXS J113155.4-123155 (z=0.66) is a quadruply imaged lensed quasar with a resolved Einstein Ring. The goal of this paper is to provide a full characterization of this system, and more particularly accurate astrometry and photometry. These observational constraints constitute a mandatory ingredient for the precise determination of the lens mass profile, the derivation of the Hubble constant H_0 from time delay measurements and investigations on the presence of massive substructures in the lensing galaxy.Methods.Visible and near-infrared imaging observations of RXS J113155.4-123155 were carried out at various epochs using several ground based telescopes and the HST. The frames have been deconvolved using the MCS algorithm. A Singular Isothermal Ellipsoid (SIE) + external shear has been used to model the lensing galaxy potential. Results. MCS deconvolution enables us to separate the flux of the QSO (point-like images) from that of its host galaxy and to accurately track the flux variations of the point-like images in various filters. The deconvolved frames unveil several multiply imaged structures in the Einstein ring and an unidentified object in the vicinity of the lensing galaxy. We discuss the lightcurves and the chromatic flux ratio variations and deduce that both intrinsic variability and microlensing took place during a span longer than one year. We demonstrate that microlensing may easily account for the so called anomalous flux ratios presented in the discovery paper. However, the observed flux ratios are still poorly reproduced when modeling the lens potential with a SIE+shear. We argue that this disagreement can hardly be explained by milli-lensing caused by substructures in the lensing galaxy. A solution proposed in Paper II consists in a more complex lens model including an octupole term to the lens gravitational potential.</abstract>

        <abstract>Aims:We discuss and characterize micro-lensing among the 3 brightest lensed images (A-B-C) of the gravitational lens system RXS J1131-1231 (a quadruply imaged AGN) by means of long slit optical and NIR spectroscopy. Qualitative constraints on the size of different emission regions are derived. We also perform a spectroscopic study of two field galaxies located within 1.6 arcmin radius from the lens.  &lt;BR /&gt;Methods: We decompose the spectra into their individual emission components using a multi-component fitting approach. A complementary decomposition of the spectra enables us to isolate the macro-lensed fraction of the spectra independently of any spectral modelling.  &lt;BR /&gt;Results: 1. The data support micro-lensing de-amplification of images A and C. Not only is the continuum emission microlensed in those images but also a fraction of the Broad Line emitting Region (BLR). 2. Micro-lensing of a very broad component of Mg ii emission line suggests that the corresponding emission occurs in a region more compact than the other components of the emission line. 3. We find evidence that a large fraction of the Fe ii emission arises in the outer parts of the BLR. We also find a very compact emitting region in the ranges 3080-3540 \AA and 4630-4800 \AA that is likely associated with Fe ii. 4. The [O iii] narrow emission line regions are partly spatially resolved. This enables us to put a lower limit of ~110h^-1 pc on their intrinsic size. 5. Analysis of Mg ii absorption found in the spectra indicates that the absorbing medium is intrinsic to the quasar, has a covering factor of 20\%, and is constituted of small clouds homogeneously distributed in front of the continuum and BLRs. 6. Two neighbour galaxies are detected at redshifts z=0.10 and z=0.289. These galaxies are possible members of galaxy groups reported at those redshifts.

        <abstract>We present the first VLT near-IR observations of a gravitationally lensed quasar, using adaptive optics and laser guide star. These observations can be considered as a test bench for future systematic observations of lensed quasars with adaptive optics, even when bright natural guide stars are not available in the nearby field. With only 14 min of observing time, we derived very accurate astrometry of the quasar images and of the lensing galaxy, with 0.05\acute\acute spatial resolution, comparable to the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). In combination with deep VLT optical spectra of the quasar images, we use our adaptive optics images to constrain simple models for the mass distribution of the lensing galaxy. The latter is almost circular and does not need any strong external shear to fit the data. The time delay predicted for SDSS J0806+2006, assuming a singular isothermal ellipsoid model and the concordance cosmology, is Delta t ~e 50 days. Our optical spectra indicate a flux ratio between the quasar images of A/B = 1.3 in the continuum and A/B = 2.2 in both the Mg ii and in the C iii] broad emission lines. This suggests that microlensing affects the continuum emission. However, the constant ratio between the two emission lines indicates that the broad emission line region is not microlensed. Finally, we see no evidence of reddening by dust in the lensing galaxy. Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, Paranal, Chile, ESO Program 079.A-0588(A).</abstract>

        <abstract>When an image of a strongly lensed quasar is microlensed, the different components of its spectrum are expected to be differentially magnified owing to the different sizes of the corresponding emitting region. Chromatic changes are expected to be observed in the continuum while the emission lines should be deformed as a function of the size, geometry and kinematics of the regions from which they originate. Microlensing of the emission lines has been reported only in a handful of systems so far. In this paper we search for microlensing deformations of the optical spectra of pairs of images in 17 lensed quasars with bolometric luminosities between 10^44.7 - 47.4 erg/s and black hole masses 10^7.6 - 9.8 M_â. This sample is composed of 13 pairs of previously unpublished spectra and four pairs of spectra from literature. Our analysis is based on a simple spectral decomposition technique which allows us to isolate the microlensed fraction of the flux independently of a detailed modeling of the quasar emission lines. Using this technique, we detect microlensing of the continuum in 85\% of the systems. Among them, 80\% show microlensing of the broad emission lines. Focusing on the most common emission lines in our spectra (C III] and Mg II) we detect microlensing of either the blue or the red wing, or of both wings with the same amplitude. This observation implies that the broad line region is not in general spherically symmetric. In addition, the frequent detection of microlensing of the blue and red wings independently but not simultaneously with a different amplitude, does not support existing microlensing simulations of a biconical outflow. Our analysis also provides the intrinsic flux ratio between the lensed images and the magnitude of the microlensing affecting the continuum. These two quantities are particularly relevant for the determination of the fraction of matter in clumpy form in galaxies and for the detection of dark matter substructures via the identification of flux ratio anomalies.

        <abstract>We report the discovery of a new quadruply imaged quasar surrounded by an optical Einstein ring candidate. Spectra of the different components of 1RXS J113155.4-123155 reveal a source at z= 0.658. Up to now, this object is the closest known gravitationally lensed quasar. The lensing galaxy is clearly detected. Its redshift is measured to be z= 0.295. Additionally, the total V magnitude of the system has varied by 0.3 mag between two epochs separated by 33 weeks. The measured relative astrometry of the lensed images is best fitted with an SIS model plus shear. This modeling suggests very high magnification of the source (up to 50 for the total magnification) and predicts flux ratios between the lensed images significantly different from what is actually observed. This suggests that the lensed images may be affected by a combination of micro or milli-lensing and dust extinction effects. Based on data collected at the European Southern Observatory, La Silla, Chile.</abstract>

        <abstract>We study the luminosity gap, Deltam_12, between the first- and second-ranked galaxies in a sample of 59 massive (~10^15M_solar) galaxy clusters, using data from the Hale Telescope, the Hubble Space Telescope, Chandra and Spitzer. We find that the Deltam_12 distribution, p(Deltam_12), is a declining function of Deltam_12 to which we fitted a straight line: p(Deltam_12) ~ -(0.13 Â± 0.02)Deltam_12. The fraction of clusters with 'large' luminosity gaps is p(Deltam_12 &amp;gt;= 1) = 0.37 Â± 0.08, which represents a 3sigma excess over that obtained from Monte Carlo simulations of a Schechter function that matches the mean cluster galaxy luminosity function. We also identify four clusters with 'extreme' luminosity gaps, Deltam_12 &amp;gt;= 2, giving a fraction of . More generally, large luminosity gap clusters are relatively homogeneous, with elliptical/discy brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs), cuspy gas density profiles (i.e. strong cool cores), high concentrations and low substructure fractions. In contrast, small luminosity gap clusters are heterogeneous, spanning the full range of boxy/elliptical/discy BCG morphologies, the full range of cool core strengths and dark matter concentrations, and have large substructure fractions. Taken together, these results imply that the amplitude of the luminosity gap is a function of both the formation epoch and the recent infall history of the cluster. 'BCG dominance' is therefore a phase that a cluster may evolve through and is not an evolutionary 'cul-de-sac'. We also compare our results with semi-analytic model predictions based on the Millennium Simulation. None of the models is able to reproduce all of the observational results on Deltam_12, underlining the inability of the current generation of models to match the empirical properties of BCGs. We identify the strength of active galactic nucleus feedback and the efficiency with which cluster galaxies are replenished after they merge with the BCG in each model as possible causes of these discrepancies.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present a comprehensive space-based study of 10 X-ray luminous galaxy clusters (L_X&amp;gt;= 8 	imes 10^44 erg s^-1, 0.1-2.4 keV) at z= 0.2. Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations reveal numerous gravitationally lensed arcs for which we present four new spectroscopic redshifts, bringing the total to 13 confirmed arcs in this cluster sample. The confirmed arcs reside in just half of the clusters; we thus obtain a firm lower limit on the fraction of clusters with a central projected mass density exceeding the critical density required for strong lensing of 50 per cent. We combine the multiple-image systems with the weakly sheared background galaxies to model the total mass distribution in the cluster cores (R&amp;lt;= 500 kpc). These models are complemented by high-resolution X-ray data from Chandra and used to develop quantitative criteria to classify the clusters as relaxed or unrelaxed. Formally, (30 Â± 20) per cent of the clusters form a relatively homogeneous subsample of relaxed clusters; the remaining (70 Â± 20) per cent are unrelaxed and are a much more diverse population. Most of the clusters therefore appear to be experiencing a cluster-cluster merger or relaxing after such an event. We also study the normalization and scatter of scaling relations between the cluster mass, the X-ray luminosity and the temperature. The scatter in these relations is dominated by the unrelaxed clusters and is typically sigma~= 0.4. Most notably, we detect two to three times more scatter in the mass-temperature relation than theoretical simulations and models predict. The observed scatter is also asymmetric - the unrelaxed clusters are systematically 40 per cent hotter than the relaxed clusters at 2.5sigma significance. This structural segregation should be a major concern for experiments designed to constrain cosmological parameters using galaxy clusters. Overall our results are consistent with a scenario of cluster-cluster merger-induced boosts to cluster X-ray luminosities and temperatures.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present the results of a survey for extremely red objects (EROs) undertaken in the fields of 10 massive galaxy cluster lenses at , combining sensitive, high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope imaging with deep, half-arcsecond K -band imaging from UKIRT. We detect 60 EROs with , of which 26 have in a total image-plane survey area of 49arcmin^2 down to , including one multiply imaged ERO. We use detailed models of the cluster lenses to quantify the lens amplification and thus correct the observed number counts and survey area for the effects of gravitational lensing. After making these corrections, we estimate surface densities at of and for EROs with and &amp;gt;=6.0 respectively. These ERO number counts agree with previous shallower surveys at , and flatten significantly at magnitudes fainter than . This flattening may be due to a transition from an ERO population dominated by evolved galaxies at to one dominated by dusty starburst galaxies at . We also compare our results with various model predictions, including a model that attempts to explain EROs in terms of a single population of elliptical galaxies formed at high redshift. We find that a formation epoch of for this population matches the observed surface density of EROs quite well, and the sample less well. More sophisticated models, including semi-analytic prescriptions, underpredict the ERO surface density by approximately an order of magnitude, suggesting that these models produce insufficient stars and/or dust at high redshift. This deficit of EROs appears to be a general problem with models that reproduce the median redshift from K -selected redshift surveys. One possible explanation is that the current K -selected redshift distribution may be incomplete beyond .</abstract>

        <abstract>We present near-infrared spectroscopy and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging of galaxy J003707+0909.5, the brightest of three gravitationally lensed images of an extremely red object (ERO) at z=1.6, in the field of the massive cluster A68 (z=0.255). We exploit the superlative resolution of our HST data and the enhanced spatial resolution and sensitivity afforded by the lens amplification to reconstruct the source-plane properties of this ERO. Our morphological and photometric analysis reveals that EROJ003707 is an L^* early-type disc galaxy and we estimate that ~10 per cent of galaxies with (R-K)&amp;gt;=5.3 and K&amp;lt;=21 may have similar properties. The unique association of passive EROs with elliptical galaxies therefore appears to be too simplistic. We speculate on the evolution of EROJ003707: if gas continues to cool on to this galaxy in the manner predicted by hierarchical galaxy formation models, then by the present day, EROJ003707 could evolve into a very luminous spiral galaxy.</abstract>

        <abstract>We use semianalytic models of structure formation to interpret gravitational lensing measurements of substructure in galaxy cluster cores (R&amp;lt;=250 h^-1 kpc) at z=0.2. The dynamic range of the lensing-based substructure fraction measurements is well matched to the theoretical predictions, both spanning f_sub~0.05-0.65. The structure formation model predicts that f_sub is correlated with cluster assembly history. We use simple fitting formulae to parameterize the predicted correlations: Delta_90=tau_90+alpha_90log(f_sub) and Delta_50=tau_50+alpha_50log(f_sub), where Delta_90 and Delta_50 are the predicted lookback times from z=0.2 to when each theoretical cluster had acquired 90\% and 50\%, respectively, of the mass it had at z=0.2. The best-fit parameter values are alpha_90=-1.34Â±0.79 Gyr, tau_90=0.31Â±0.56 Gyr and alpha_50=-2.77Â±1.66 Gyr, tau_50=0.99Â±1.18 Gyr. Therefore, (1) observed clusters with f_sub&amp;lt;~0.1 (e.g., A383, A1835) are interpreted, on average, to have formed at z&amp;gt;~0.8 and to have suffered &amp;lt;=10\% mass growth since z~=0.4, and (2) observed clusters with f_sub&amp;gt;~0.4 (e.g., A68, A773) are interpreted as, on average, forming since z~=0.4 and suffering &amp;gt;10\% mass growth in the ~500 Myr preceding z=0.2, i.e., since z=0.25. In summary, observational measurements of f_sub can be combined with structure formation models to estimate the age and assembly history of observed clusters. The ability to ''age date" approximately clusters in this way has numerous applications to the large samples of clusters that are becoming available.</abstract>

        <abstract>VLA observations at 8.4 and 15 GHz of a sample of 119 inverted-spectrum radio sources revealed that one object, 1608+656, consists of four components in a configuration suggestive of gravitational lensing. The maximum separation between individual components is 2."1. An independent discovery of this object was made through the Cosmic Lens All-Sky Survey, as reported in the companion paper (Myers et al. 1995). All four components have similar flat spectral indices, consistent with lensing. The lensed source is found to be the nucleus of a radio galaxy with double-lobed structure of unusually large physical dimensions and a luminosity at the Fanaroff-Riley class I--II transition. The core of 1608+656 has a flat spectrum from 1.4 to 18.5 GHz, but the flux density falls significantly below 1 GHz. The observed core-lobe ratio is about 1:4 at 1.4 GHz. The southwestern lobe is highly polarized, while the northeastern lobe is unpolarized, properties reminiscent of the Laing-Garrington depolarization asymmetry in low-redshift radio galaxies.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging data and CFHT Near IR ground-based images for the final sample of 56 candidate galaxy-scale lenses uncovered in the CFHT Legacy Survey as part of the Strong Lensing in the Legacy Survey (SL2S) project. The new images are used to perform lens modeling, measure surface photometry, and estimate stellar masses of the deflector early-type galaxies. Lens modeling is performed on the HST images (or CFHT when HST is not available) by fitting the spatially extended light distribution of the lensed features assuming a singular isothermal ellipsoid mass profile and by reconstructing the intrinsic source light distribution on a pixelized grid. Based on the analysis of systematic uncertainties and comparison with inference based on different methods we estimate that our Einstein Radii are accurate to ~3%. HST imaging provides a much higher success rate in confirming gravitational lenses and measuring their Einstein radii than CFHT imaging does. Lens modeling with ground-based images however, when successful, yields Einstein radius measurements that are competitive with spaced-based images. Information from the lens models is used together with spectroscopic information from the companion paper IV to classify the systems, resulting in a final sample of 39 confirmed (grade-A) lenses and 17 promising candidates. The redshifts of the main deflector span a range 0.3&lt;zd&lt; 0.8, providing an excellent sample for the study of the cosmic evolution of the mass distribution of early-type galaxies over the second half of the history of the Universe.</abstract>

        <abstract>Stars and dark matter account for most of the mass of early-type galaxies, but uncertainties in the stellar population and the dark matter profile make it challenging to distinguish between the two components. Nevertheless, precise observations of stellar and dark matter are extremely valuable for testing the many models of structure formation and evolution. We present a measurement of the stellar mass and inner slope of the dark matter halo of a massive early-type galaxy at z = 0.222. The galaxy is the foreground deflector of the double Einstein ring gravitational lens system SDSSJ0946+1006, also known as the ''Jackpot.'' By combining the tools of lensing and dynamics we first constrain the mean slope of the total mass density profile (\backslashrho \_\tot\\backslashpropto r^\-\backslashgamma ^\\backslashprime \\) within the radius of the outer ring to be gamma' = 1.98 Â± 0.02 Â± 0.01. Then we obtain a bulge-halo decomposition, assuming a power-law form for the dark matter halo. Our analysis yields gamma_DM = 1.7 Â± 0.2 for the inner slope of the dark matter profile, in agreement with theoretical findings on the distribution of dark matter in ellipticals, and a stellar mass from lensing and dynamics M ^LD _* = 5.5_--1.3 ^+0.4 \times 10^11 M _â. By comparing this measurement with stellar masses inferred from stellar population synthesis fitting we find that a Salpeter initial mass function (IMF) provides a good description of the stellar population of the lens while the probability of the IMF being heavier than Chabrier is 95\%. Our data suggest that growth by accretion of small systems from a compact red nugget is a plausible formation scenario for this object.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present optical and near infrared spectroscopy obtained at Keck, VLT, and Gemini for a sample of 36 secure strong gravitational lens systems and 17 candidates identified as part of the SL2S survey. The deflectors are massive early-type galaxies in the redshift range z_d=0.2-0.8, while the lensed sources are at z_s=1-3.5. We combine this data with photometric and lensing measurements presented in the companion paper III and with lenses from the SLACS and LSD surveys to investigate the cosmic evolution of the internal structure of massive early-type galaxies over half the age of the universe. We study the dependence of the slope of the total mass density profile gamma' (rho(r)\propto r^-gamma') on stellar mass, size, and redshift. We find that two parameters are sufficent to determine gamma' with less than 6% residual scatter. At fixed redshift, gamma' depends solely on the surface stellar mass density \partial gamma'/ \partial Sigma_*=0.38Â± 0.07, i.e. galaxies with denser stars also have steeper slopes. At fixed M_* and R_eff, gamma' depends on redshift, in the sense that galaxies at a lower redshift have steeper slopes (\partial gamma' / \partial z = -0.31Â± 0.10). However, the mean redshift evolution of gamma' for an individual galaxy is consistent with zero dgamma'/dz=-0.10Â±0.12. This result is obtained by combining our measured dependencies of gamma' on z,M_*,R_eff with the evolution of the R_eff-M_* taken from the literature, and is broadly consistent with current models of the formation and evolution of massive early-type galaxies. Detailed quantitative comparisons of our results with theory will provide qualitatively new information on the detailed physical processes at work.</abstract>

From the spectral analysis of the arc it is now well established that all its segments (including the eastern end) have the same spectrum. Some emission and absorption features identified in the spectrum definitely prove that the arc is the image of a late type galaxy at a redshift of 0.724. Gravitational lensing of a background galaxy by the cluster core results as the most convincing model of the observed configuration.</abstract>

        <abstract>Bright gravitationally lensed galaxies provide our most detailed view of galaxies at high redshift. The very brightest (r &amp;lt; 21) systems enable high spatial and spectral resolution measurements, offering unique constraints on the outflow energetics, metallicity gradients and stellar populations in high-redshift galaxies. Yet as a result of the small number of ultrabright z ~e 2 lensed systems with confirmed redshifts, most detailed spectroscopic studies have been limited in their scope. With the goal of increasing the number of bright lensed galaxies available for detailed follow-up, we have undertaken a spectroscopic campaign targeting wide separation (\gsim3 arcsec) galaxy-galaxy lens candidates within the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Building on the earlier efforts of our Cambridge and Sloan Survey Of Wide Arcs in Thesky survey, we target a large sample of candidate galaxy-galaxy lens systems in SDSS using a well-established search algorithm which identifies blue arc-like structures situated around luminous red galaxies. In this paper, we present a new redshift catalogue containing 29 lensed sources in SDSS confirmed through spectroscopic follow-up of candidate galaxy-galaxy lens systems. Included in this new sample are two of the brightest galaxies (r = 19.6 and 19.7) known at z ~e 2, a low metallicity (12 + log (O/H) ~e 8.0) extreme nebular line emitting galaxy at z = 1.43, and numerous systems for which detailed follow-up will be possible. The source redshifts span 0.9 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 2.5 (median redshift of 1.9), and their optical magnitudes are in the range 19.6 \lsim r \lsim 22.3. We present a brief source-by-source discussion of the spectroscopic properties extracted from our confirmatory spectra and discuss some initial science results. Preliminary lens modelling reveals average source magnifications of 5-10 times. With more than 50 gravitationally lensed z \gsim 1 galaxies now confirmed within SDSS, it will soon be possible for the first time to develop generalized conclusions from detailed spectroscopic studies of the brightest lensed systems at high redshift.</abstract>

        <abstract>The authors have begun a systematic search from ESO for gravitational lens systems in a selected sample of highly luminous quasars; M_V &amp;lt; -29.0. They give a brief description of their first identified gravitational lens system UM673 = Q0142-100 = PHL3703. It consists of two images, A (m_R = 16.9) and B (m_R = 19.1), separated by 2.2 arc s at a redshift z_q = 2.719. The lensing galaxy (m_R \ap 19, Z_L \ap 0.49) has also been found. It lies very near the line connecting the two QSO images, \equiv0.8 arc s from the fainter one. A value M_0 \ap 2.4\times10^11M\_sun; for the mass of the lensing galaxy and Deltat \ap 7 weeks for most likely travel-time difference between the two light paths to the QSO are found (assuming H_0 = 75 km s^-1Mpc^-1, q_0 = 0).</abstract>

        <abstract>Strong gravitational lensing by groups or clusters of galaxies provides a powerful technique to measure the dark matter properties of individual lens galaxies. We study in detail the mass distribution of the satellite lens galaxy in the group-scale lens SL2S J08544-0121 by modelling simultaneously the spatially extended surface brightness distribution of the source galaxy and the lens mass distribution using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. In particular, we measure the dark matter halo size of the satellite lens galaxy to be 6.0+2.9-2.0 kpc with a fiducial velocity dispersion of 127+21-12 km s-1. This is the first time the size of an individual galaxy halo in a galaxy group has been measured using strong gravitational lensing without assumptions of mass following light. We verify the robustness of our halo size measurement using mock data resembling our lens system. Our measurement of the halo size is compatible with the estimated tidal radius of the satellite galaxy, suggesting that halos of galaxies in groups experience significant tidal stripping, a process that has been previously observed on galaxies in clusters. Our mass model of the satellite galaxy is elliptical with its major axis misaligned with that of the light by ~50&amp;deg;. The major axis of the total matter distribution is oriented more towards the centre of the host halo, exhibiting the radial alignment found in N-body simulations and observational studies of satellite galaxies. This misalignment between mass and light poses a significant challenge to modified Newtonian dynamics.

        <abstract>Measuring the relative mass contributions of luminous and dark matter in spiral galaxies is important for understanding their formation and evolution. The combination of a galaxy rotation curve and strong lensing is a powerful way to break the disk-halo degeneracy that is inherent in each of the methods individually. We present an analysis of the 10 image radio spiral lens B1933+503 at z _l = 0.755, incorporating (1) new global very long baseline interferometry observations, (2) new adaptive-optics-assisted K-band imaging, and (3) new spectroscopic observations for the lens galaxy rotation curve and the source redshift. We construct a three-dimensionally axisymmetric mass distribution with three components: an exponential profile for the disk, a point mass for the bulge, and a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile for the halo. The mass model is simultaneously fitted to the kinematics and the lensing data. The NFW halo needs to be oblate with a flattening of a/c = 0.33^+0.07 _-0.05 to be consistent with the radio data. This suggests that baryons are effective at making the halos oblate near the center. The lensing and kinematics analysis probe the inner \~10 kpc of the galaxy, and we obtain a lower limit on the halo scale radius of 16 kpc (95\\% credible intervals). The dark matter mass fraction inside a sphere with a radius of 2.2 disk scale lengths is f _DM, 2.2 = 0.43^+0.10 _-0.09. The contribution of the disk to the total circular velocity at 2.2 disk scale lengths is 0.76^+0.05 _-0.06, suggesting that the disk is marginally submaximal. The stellar mass of the disk from our modeling is log_10(M _*/M _â) = 11.06^+0.09 _-0.11 assuming that the cold gas contributes \~20\\% to the total disk mass. In comparison to the stellar masses estimated from stellar population synthesis models, the stellar initial mass function of Chabrier is preferred to that of Salpeter by a probability factor of 7.2.</abstract>

        <abstract>Strong gravitational lens systems with measured time delays between the multiple images provide a method for measuring the "time-delay distance" to the lens, and thus the Hubble constant. We present a Bayesian analysis of the strong gravitational lens system B1608+656, incorporating (1) new, deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations, (2) a new velocity-dispersion measurement of 260 plusmn 15 km s^-1 for the primary lens galaxy, and (3) an updated study of the lens environment. Our analysis of the HST images takes into account the extended source surface brightness, and the dust extinction and optical emission by the interacting lens galaxies. When modeling the stellar dynamics of the primary lens galaxy, the lensing effect, and the environment of the lens, we explicitly include the total mass distribution profile logarithmic slope gamma and the external convergence kappa_ext we marginalize over these parameters, assigning well-motivated priors for them, and so turn the major systematic errors into statistical ones. The HST images provide one such prior, constraining the lens mass density profile logarithmic slope to be gamma = 2.08 plusmn 0.03; a combination of numerical simulations and photometric observations of the B1608+656 field provides an estimate of the prior for kappa_ext: 0.10^+0.08 _-0.05. This latter distribution dominates the final uncertainty on H _0. Fixing the cosmological parameters at Omega_m = 0.3, Omega_Lambda = 0.7, and w = -1 in order to compare with previous work on this system, we find H _0 = 70.6^+3.1 _-3.1 km s^-1 Mpc^-1. The new data provide an increase in precision of more than a factor of 2, even including the marginalization over kappa_ext. Relaxing the prior probability density function for the cosmological parameters to that derived from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) five-year data set, we find that the B1608+656 data set breaks the degeneracy between Omega_m and Omega_Lambda at w = -1 and constrains the curvature parameter to be -0.031 &amp;lt; Omega_k &amp;lt; 0.009 (95% CL), a level of precision comparable to that afforded by the current Type Ia SNe sample. Asserting a flat spatial geometry, we find that, in combination with WMAP, H _0 = 69.7^+4.9 _-5.0 km s^-1 Mpc^-1 and w = -0.94^+0.17 _-0.19 (68% CL), suggesting that the observations of B1608+656 constrain w as tightly as the current Baryon Acoustic Oscillation data do.

        <abstract>Strong gravitational lensing is a powerful technique for probing galaxy mass distributions and for measuring cosmological parameters. Lens systems with extended source-intensity distributions are particularly useful for this purpose since they provide additional constraints on the lens potential (mass distribution). We present a pixelated approach to modeling the lens potential and source-intensity distribution simultaneously. The method makes iterative and perturbative corrections to an initial potential model. For systems with sources of sufficient extent such that the separate lensed images are connected by intensity measurements, the accuracy in the reconstructed potential is solely limited by the quality of the data. We apply this potential reconstruction technique to deep Hubble Space Telescope observations of B1608+656, a four-image gravitational lens system formed by a pair of interacting lens galaxies. We present a comprehensive Bayesian analysis of the system that takes into account the extended source-intensity distribution, dust extinction, and the interacting lens galaxies. Our approach allows us to compare various models of the components of the lens system, which include the point-spread function (PSF), dust, lens galaxy light, source-intensity distribution, and lens potential. Using optimal combinations of the PSF, dust, and lens galaxy light models, we successfully reconstruct both the lens potential and the extended source-intensity distribution of B1608+656. The resulting reconstruction can be used as the basis of a measurement of the Hubble constant. As an illustration of the astrophysical applications of our method, we use our reconstruction of the gravitational potential to study the relative distribution of mass and light in the lensing galaxies. We find that the mass-to-light ratio for the primary lens galaxy is (2.0 plusmn 0.2)h M _sun L ^-1 _B,sun within the Einstein radius (3.9 h^-1 kpc), in agreement with what is found for noninteracting lens galaxies at the same scales.

        <abstract>We report the discovery of the most complex arcsec-scale radio gravitational lens system yet known. B1933+503 was found during the course of the CLASS survey and MERLIN and VLA radio maps reveal up to 10 components. Four of these are compact and have flat spectra; the rest are more extended and have steep spectra. The background lensed object appears to consist of a flat-spectrum core (quadruply imaged) and two compact 'lobes' symmetrically disposed relative to the core. One of the lobes is quadruply imaged while the other is doubly imaged. An HST observation of the system with the WFPC2 shows a galaxy with an axial ratio of 0.5, but none of the images of the background object is detected. A redshift of 0.755 has been measured for the lens galaxy.</abstract>

        <abstract>The redshifts of the gravitational lens galaxies in MG 1131+0456 and B1938+666 are 0.844 and 0.881, respectively. Both are early-type galaxies lying at the redshifts predicted by assuming that they are early-type galaxies with old stellar populations lying on the fundamental plane. We also find evidence for a foreground group of galaxies at z=0.343 near MG 1131+0456. The source redshifts are predicted to be &amp;gt;~1.8 in both systems, but they are so red that infrared spectra will be required to determine their redshifts. Based on observations at the W. M.

        <abstract>We report redshifts in two gravitational lens systems, MG 0414+0534 and MG 0751+2716. The lens galaxy in MG 0414+0534 lies at z\_l=0.9584Â±0.0002. The luminosity and extreme red color of the lens are thus typical of a passively evolving early-type ~2L\_* galaxy. The galaxy cannot have a significant global mean extinction without being anomalously luminous. The lens galaxy in MG 0751+2716 has a redshift of z\_l=0.3502Â±0.0003, and it is a member of a small group. The group includes the nearby bright companion galaxy whose redshift we confirmed to be z=0.3501Â±0.0001 and a nearby emission-line galaxy with z=0.3505Â±0.0003. A second emission-line galaxy with z=0.5216Â±0.0001 was found nearly superposed on the first emission-line galaxy. The source in MG 0751+2716 is a z\_s=3.200Â±0.001 radio quasar. For flat universes with Omega\_0=1.0 (0.3), 96\% (87\%) of lenses like MG 0414+0534 and 7\% (3\%) of lenses like MG 0751+2716 are expected to have lower lens redshifts than observed.</abstract>

        <abstract>We determine an absolute calibration of the initial mass function (IMF) of early-type galaxies, by studying a sample of 56 gravitational lenses identified by the Sloan Lenses ACS Survey. Under the assumption of standard Navarro, Frenk, and White dark matter halos, a combination of lensing, dynamical, and stellar population synthesis models is used to disentangle the stellar and dark matter contribution for each lens. We define an "IMF mismatch" parameter alphaequivM ^LD _*,Ein/M ^SPS _*,Ein as the ratio of stellar mass inferred by a joint lensing and dynamical model (M ^LD _*,Ein) to the current stellar mass inferred from stellar populations synthesis models (M ^SPS _*,Ein). We find that a Salpeter IMF provides stellar masses in agreement with those inferred by lensing and dynamical models (langlog alpharang = -0.00 Â± 0.03 Â± 0.02), while a Chabrier IMF underestimates them (langlog alpharang = 0.25 Â± 0.03 Â± 0.02). A tentative trend is found, in the sense that alpha appears to increase with galaxy velocity dispersion. Taken at face value, this result would imply a non-universal IMF, perhaps dependent on metallicity, age, or abundance ratios of the stellar populations. Alternatively, the observed trend may imply non-universal dark matter halos with inner density slope increasing with velocity dispersion. While the degeneracy between the two interpretations cannot be broken without additional information, the data imply that massive early-type galaxies cannot have both a universal IMF and universal dark matter halos.

        <abstract>The relative contribution of baryons and dark matter to the inner regions of spiral galaxies provides critical clues to their formation and evolution, but it is generally difficult to determine. For spiral galaxies that are strong gravitational lenses, however, the combination of lensing and kinematic observations can be used to break the disc-halo degeneracy. In turn, such data constrain fundamental parameters such as (i) the mass density profile slope and axial ratio of the dark matter halo, and by comparison with dark matter-only numerical simulations the modifications imposed by baryons; (ii) the mass in stars and therefore the overall star formation efficiency, and the amount of feedback; (iii) by comparison with stellar population synthesis models, the normalization of the stellar initial mass function. In this first paper of a series, we present a sample of 16 secure, one probable and six possible strong lensing spiral galaxies, for which multiband high-resolution images and rotation curves were obtained using the Hubble Space Telescope and Keck II telescope as part of the Sloan WFC Edge-on Late-type Lens Survey (SWELLS). The sample includes eight newly discovered secure systems. We characterize the sample of deflector galaxies in terms of their morphologies, structural parameters and stellar masses. We find that the SWELLS sample of secure lenses spans a broad range of morphologies (from lenticular to late-type spiral), spectral types (quantified by Halpha emission) and bulge to total stellar mass ratio (0.22-0.85), while being limited to M_* gt 10^10.5 M_â. The SWELLS sample is thus well suited for exploring the relationship between dark and luminous matter in a broad range of galaxies. We find that the deflector galaxies obey the same size-mass relation as that of a comparison sample of elongated non-lens galaxies selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We conclude that the SWELLS sample is consistent with being representative of the overall population of high-mass high-inclination discy galaxies.</abstract>

        <abstract>We study the relation between the internal structure of early-type galaxies and their environment using 70 strong gravitational lenses from the SLACS Survey. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) database is used to determine two measures of overdensity of galaxies around each lensmdashthe projected number density of galaxies inside the tenth nearest neighbor (Sigma_10) and within a cone of radius one h ^-1 Mpc (D _1). Our main results are as follows. (1) The average overdensity is somewhat larger than unity, consistent with lenses preferring overdense environments as expected for massive early-type galaxies (12/70 lenses are in known groups/clusters). (2) The distribution of overdensities is indistinguishable from that of "twin" nonlens galaxies selected from SDSS to have the same redshift and stellar velocity dispersion sigma_*. Thus, within our errors, lens galaxies are an unbiased population, and the SLACS results can be generalized to the overall population of early-type galaxies. (3) Typical contributions from external mass distribution are no more than a few percent in local mass density, reaching 10-20\% (~0.05-0.10 external convergence) only in the most extreme overdensities. (4) No significant correlation between overdensity and slope of the mass-density profile of the lens galaxies is found. (5) Satellite galaxies (those with a more luminous companion) have marginally steeper mass-density profiles (as quantified by f _SIE = sigma_*/sigma_SIE = 1.12 Â± 0.05 versus 1.01 Â± 0.01) and smaller dynamically normalized mass enclosed within the Einstein radius (Deltalog M _Ein/M _dim differs by -0.09 Â± 0.03 dex) than central galaxies (those without). This result suggests that tidal stripping may affect the mass structure of early-type galaxies down to kpc scales probed by strong lensing, when they fall into larger structures.

        <abstract>We use HST images to derive effective radii and effective surface brightnesses of 15 early-type (E+S0) lens galaxies identified by the SLACS Survey. Our measurements are combined with stellar velocity dispersions from the SDSS database to investigate for the first time the distribution of lens galaxies in the fundamental plane (FP) space. Accounting for selection effects (top priority to the largest Einstein radii and thus approximately to the largest velocity dispersions, sigma&amp;gt;~240 km s^-1) and for passive evolution, the distribution of the lens galaxies inside the FP is indistinguishable from that of the parent sample of SDSS galaxies. We conclude that SLACS lenses are a fair sample of high velocity dispersion E+S0s. By comparing the central stellar velocity dispersion (sigma) with the velocity dispersion that best fits the lensing models (sigma_SIE) we find &amp;lt;f_SIE&amp;gt;equiv&amp;lt;sigma/sigma_SIE&amp;gt;=1.01Â±0.02 with 0.065 rms scatter. We infer that within the Einstein radii (typically R_e/2) the SLACS lenses are very well approximated by isothermal ellipsoids, requiring a fine tuning of the stellar and dark matter distribution (the bulge-halo ''conspiracy"). Interpreting the offset from the local FP in terms of evolution of the stellar mass-to-light ratio, we find dlog(M/L_B)/dz=-0.69Â±0.08 (rms 0.11) consistent with the rate found for field E+S0s and with most of the stars being old (z_f&amp;gt;2) and less than ~10\% of the stellar mass having formed below z=1. We discuss our results in the context of formation mechanisms such as collisionless (''dry") mergers.

        <abstract>A deep spectrum taken with the Echelle Spectrograph and Imager (ESI) at the Keck II Telescope as part of the Lenses Structure and Dynamics (LSD) Survey reveals the redshifts of the extremely red source of the radio Einstein ring in the gravitational lens system MG 1549+305 (z_s= 1.170 Â± 0.001) and an intermediate-redshift lensed spiral galaxy (z_G2= 0.604 Â± 0.001). The source redshift allows us to determine the mass of the SB0 lens galaxy enclosed by the Einstein radius (R_E= 1.15 Â± 0.05 arcsec): M_E\equivM(&amp;lt;R_E) = 8.4 Â± 0.7 \times 10^10h^-1_65 M_solar. This corresponds to a singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) velocity dispersion sigma_SIE= 214 Â± 5 km s^-1, in good agreement with the measured stellar velocity dispersion sigma= 227 Â± 18 km s^-1. The mass-to-light ratio within the Einstein radius (~1.4 effective radii) is 10 Â± 1 h_65 M_solar/L_B, solar. This is only marginally larger than typical stellar mass-to-light ratios of local early-type galaxies, indicating that dark matter is not likely to be dominant inside the Einstein radius.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present a total of 4784 unique broad absorption line quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Third Data Release. An automated algorithm was used to match a continuum to each quasar and to identify regions of flux at least 10\% below the continuum over a velocity range of at least 1000 km s^-1 in the C IV and Mg II absorption regions. The model continuum was selected as the best-fit match from a set of template quasar spectra binned in luminosity, emission line width, and redshift, with the power-law spectral index and amount of dust reddening as additional free parameters. We characterize our sample through the traditional ''balnicity" index and a revised absorption index, as well as through parameters such as the width, outflow velocity, fractional depth, and number of troughs. From a sample of 16,883 quasars at 1.7&amp;lt;=z&amp;lt;=4.38, we identify 4386 (26.0\%) quasars with broad C IV absorption, of which 1756 (10.4\%) satisfy traditional selection criteria. From a sample of 34,973 quasars at 0.5&amp;lt;=z&amp;lt;=2.15, we identify 457 (1.31\%) quasars with broad Mg II absorption, 191 (0.55\%) of which satisfy traditional selection criteria. We also provide a supplementary list of 39 visually identified z&amp;gt;4.38 quasars with broad C IV absorption. We find that broad absorption line quasars may have broader emission lines on average than other quasars.</abstract>

        <abstract>Abstract
Context: The Strong Lensing Legacy Survey (SL2S) provides a sample of the strong lensing events associated with massive distant galaxies, some of which lie in the outskirts of galaxy groups and clusters.
Aims: We investigate the internal structure of early-type galaxies in overdense environments, where tidal forces are expected to alter dark matter haloes of infalling galaxies.
Methods: SL2SJ02176-0513 is a remarkable lens for the presence of two multiply-imaged systems at different redshifts lensed by a foreground massive galaxy at z_lens = 0.656: a bright cusp arc at z_arc = 1.847 and an additional double-image system at an estimated redshift of z_dbl ~ 2.9 based on photometry and lensing geometry. The system is located about 400 kpc away from the centre of a massive group of galaxies. Mass estimates for the group are available from X-ray observations and satellite kinematics. Multicolour photometry provides an estimate of the stellar mass of the main lens galaxy. The lensing galaxy is modelled with two components (stars and dark matter), and we include the perturbing effect of the group environment and all available constraints.
Results: We find that classic lensing degeneracies, e.g. between external convergence and mass density slope, are significantly reduced with respect to standard systems and infer tight constraints on the mass density profile: (i) the dark matter content of the main lens galaxy is in line with that of typical galaxies fdm(&lt;R_e)=0.41+0.09-0.06; (ii) the required mass associated with the dark matter halo of the nearby group is consistent with X-ray (sigma_grp=550+130-240); (iii) accounting for the group contribution in the form of an external convergence, the slope of the mass density profile of the main lens galaxy alone is found to be alpha=-1.03+0.22-0.16, consistent with the isothermal (alpha = -1) slope.
Conclusions: We demonstrate that multiple source plane systems together with good ancillary dataset can be used to disentangle local and environmental effects.</abstract>

        <abstract>We describe a search for a new type of object - large clouds of hot gas with no visible galaxies - which we call failed clusters of galaxies. We calculate the expected X-ray luminosity, temperature, and angular diameter of such objects as a function of total cloud mass and convert the results to expected X-ray fluxes from failed clusters at different redshifts. Using the Einstein Imaging Proportional Counter (IPC) database, we establish a strategy to search for candidate failed clusters. From this initial screening of 1435 IPC fields, 17 candidates are selected for more detailed analysis, which indicates that 10 of these are very probably extended X-ray sources. Optical follow-up on the 10 prime candidates finds eight clusters of galaxies (including six reported for the first time in this paper), one stellar identification, and one without an obvious optical counterpart (the candidate with the weakest evidence for X-ray extent). Investigation of several candidates with less evidence for X-ray extent yields two additional new clusters of galaxies. A conservative comparison of our results with the Einstein Extended Medium Sensitivity Survey demonstrates that failed clusters are a relatively unimportant contributor to the mass density of the universe. Our inability to find failed clusters is consistent with the hierarchical clustering scenario for the formation of galaxies and clusters.</abstract>

        <abstract>After decades of searching, the true nature of dark matter still eludes us. One potential probe of the form of dark matter in galaxy clusters is to search for microlensing variability in the giant arcs and arclets. In this paper, a simple method is introduced to characterize pixel variability in the limit of high optical depth to microlensing. Expanding on earlier work, the expected microlensing signal for two massive clusters, A2218 and A370 is calculated. It is found that the microlensing signal depends sensitively upon the mix of smooth and compact dark matter in the cluster. Comparison of two deep exposures taken with James Webb Space Telescope or 2-h exposures taken with a 30-m class telescope in two epochs separated by a few years will possibly detect a few dozen pixels that show strong variability due to microlensing at the 5sigma level, revealing a wealth of information on the microlensing population.</abstract>

        <abstract>In this Letter we present calibrated mass and light profiles of the rich cluster of galaxies Abell 1689 out to 1 h^-1 Mpc from the center. The high surface density of faint blue galaxies at high redshift, selected by their low surface brightness, is a unique tool for mapping the projected mass distribution of foreground mass concentrations. The systematic gravitational lens distortions of 10^4 of these background galaxies in 15' fields reveal detailed mass profiles for intervening clusters of galaxies and are a direct measure of the growth of mass inhomogeneity. The mass is measured directly, avoiding uncertainties encountered in velocity or X-ray derived mass estimates. Mass in the rich cluster Abell 1689 follows smoothed light, outside 100 h^1 kpc, with a rest frame V-band mass-to-light ratio of 400\Â±60 h^-1 (M/L_v)_sun. Near the cluster center, mass appears to be more smoothly distributed than light. From 200 h^-1 kpc to 1 h^-1 Mpc radius the surface density follows a steeper than isothermal profile. Comparing with preliminary high-resolution N-body clustering simulations for various cosmogonies on these scales, these data are incompatible with hot dark matter, are a poor fit to most mixed dark matter models, and favor open or \lambda \&amp;gt; 0 cold dark matter. Substructure is seen in both the mass and the light, but detailed correspondence is erased on scales less than 100 h^-1 kpc.</abstract>

        <abstract>We derive an accurate mass distribution of the galaxy cluster MACS J1206.2-0847 (z = 0.439) from a combined weak-lensing distortion, magnification, and strong-lensing analysis of wide-field Subaru BVR _c I _c z' imaging and our recent 16-band Hubble Space Telescope observations taken as part of the Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble program. We find good agreement in the regions of overlap between several weak- and strong-lensing mass reconstructions using a wide variety of modeling methods, ensuring consistency. The Subaru data reveal the presence of a surrounding large-scale structure with the major axis running approximately northwest-southeast (NW-SE), aligned with the cluster and its brightest galaxy shapes, showing elongation with a ~2: 1 axis ratio in the plane of the sky. Our full-lensing mass profile exhibits a shallow profile slope dln Sigma/dln R ~ -1 at cluster outskirts (R &amp;gt;~ 1 Mpc h ^-1), whereas the mass distribution excluding the NW-SE excess regions steepens farther out, well described by the Navarro-Frenk-White form. Assuming a spherical halo, we obtain a virial mass M _vir = (1.1 Â± 0.2 Â± 0.1) \times 10^15 M _â h ^-1 and a halo concentration c _vir = 6.9 Â± 1.0 Â± 1.2 (c _vir ~ 5.7 when the central 50 kpc h ^-1 is excluded), which falls in the range 4 &amp;lt;~ langcrang &amp;lt;~ 7 of average c(M, z) predictions for relaxed clusters from recent Lambda cold dark matter simulations. Our full-lensing results are found to be in agreement with X-ray mass measurements where the data overlap, and when combined with Chandra gas mass measurements, they yield a cumulative gas mass fraction of 13.7^+4.5 _- 3.0\% at 0.7 Mpc h ^-1(\ap 1.7 r _2500), a typical value observed for high-mass clusters. Based in part on data collected at the Subaru Telescope, which is operated by the National Astronomical Society of Japan.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report new estimates of the time delays in the quadruple gravitationally lensed quasar PG 1115+080, obtained from the monitoring data in filter R with the 1.5-m telescope at the Maidanak Mountain (Uzbekistan, Central Asia) in 2004-2006. The time delays are 16.4 d between images C and B and 12 d between C and A1+A2, with image C leading for both pairs. The only known estimates of the time delays in PG 1115 are those based on observations by Schechter et al. -23.7 and 9.4 d between images C and B, and C and A1+A2, respectively, - and as revised by Barkana -25 and 13.3 d for the same image components, but with the use of another method. The new values of time delays in PG 1115+080 may be expected to provide larger estimates of the Hubble constant, thus decreasing a diversity between the H_0 estimates taken from gravitationally lensed quasars and those taken from other methods.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present a catalog of morphological and color data for galaxies with 21 &amp;lt;I\_814\_ &amp;lt; 25 mag in the Hubble Deep Field (Williams et al. 1996). Galaxies have been inspected and (when possible) independently visually classified on the MDS and DDO systems. Measurements of central concentration and asymmetry are also included in the catalog. The fraction of interacting and merging objects is seen to be significantly higher in the Hubble Deep Field than it is among nearby galaxies. Barred spirals are essentially absent from the deep sample. The fraction of early-type galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field is similar to the fraction of early-types in the Shapley-Ames Catalog, but the fraction of galaxies resembling archetypal grand-design late-type spiral galaxies is dramatically lower in the distant HDF sample.</abstract>

        <abstract>The mass function of dwarf satellite galaxies that are observed around Local Group galaxies differs substantially from simulations based on cold dark matter: the simulations predict many more dwarf galaxies than are seen. The Local Group, however, may be anomalous in this regard. A massive dark satellite in an early-type lens galaxy at a redshift of 0.222 was recently found using a method based on gravitational lensing, suggesting that the mass fraction contained in substructure could be higher than is predicted from simulations. The lack of very low-mass detections, however, prohibited any constraint on their mass function. Here we report the presence of a (1.9Â±0.1)\times10^8 dark satellite galaxy in the Einstein ring system JVAS B1938+666 (ref. 11) at a redshift of 0.881, where denotes the solar mass. This satellite galaxy has a mass similar to that of the Sagittarius galaxy, which is a satellite of the Milky Way. We determine the logarithmic slope of the mass function for substructure beyond the local Universe to be , with an average mass fraction of per cent, by combining data on both of these recently discovered galaxies. Our results are consistent with the predictions from cold dark matter simulations at the 95 per cent confidence level, and therefore agree with the view that galaxies formed hierarchically in a Universe composed of cold dark matter.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report the results of an 87 deg^2 point-source survey centered at R.A. 5^h30^m, decl. -55Â° taken with the South Pole Telescope at 1.4 and 2.0 mm wavelengths with arcminute resolution and milli-Jansky depth. Based on the ratio of flux in the two bands, we separate the detected sources into two populations, one consistent with synchrotron emission from active galactic nuclei and the other consistent with thermal emission from dust. We present source counts for each population from 11 to 640 mJy at 1.4 mm and from 4.4 to 800 mJy at 2.0 mm. The 2.0 mm counts are dominated by synchrotron-dominated sources across our reported flux range; the 1.4 mm counts are dominated by synchrotron-dominated sources above ~15 mJy and by dust-dominated sources below that flux level. We detect 141 synchrotron-dominated sources and 47 dust-dominated sources at signal-to-noise ratio S/N &gt;4.5 in at least one band. All of the most significantly detected members of the synchrotron-dominated population are associated with sources in previously published radio catalogs. Some of the dust-dominated sources are associated with nearby (z &lt; 1) galaxies whose dust emission is also detected by the Infrared Astronomy Satellite. However, most of the bright, dust-dominated sources have no counterparts in any existing catalogs. We argue that these sources represent the rarest and brightest members of the population commonly referred to as submillimeter galaxies (SMGs). Because these sources are selected at longer wavelengths than in typical SMG surveys, they are expected to have a higher mean redshift distribution and may provide a new window on galaxy formation in the early universe.</abstract>

        <abstract>In the past decade, our understanding of galaxy evolution has been revolutionized by the discovery that luminous, dusty starburst galaxies were 1,000 times more abundant in the early Universe than at present. It has, however, been difficult to measure the complete redshift distribution of these objects, especially at the highest redshifts (z\&amp;gt;4). Here we report a redshift survey at a wavelength of three millimetres, targeting carbon monoxide line emission from the star-forming molecular gas in the direction of extraordinarily bright millimetre-wave-selected sources. High-resolution imaging demonstrates that these sources are strongly gravitationally lensed by foreground galaxies. We detect spectral lines in 23 out of 26 sources and multiple lines in 12 of those 23 sources, from which we obtain robust, unambiguous redshifts. At least 10 of the sources are found to lie at z\&amp;gt;4, indicating that the fraction of dusty starburst galaxies at high redshifts is greater than previously thought. Models of lens geometries in the sample indicate that the background objects are ultra-luminous infrared galaxies, powered by extreme bursts of star formation.</abstract>

        <abstract>Aims:Our aim is to measure the time delay between the two gravitationally lensed images of the z\_qso = 1.547 quasar SDSS J1650+4251, in order to estimate the Hubble constant H\_0. &lt;BR /&gt;Methods: Our measurement is based on R-band light curves with 57 epochs obtained at Maidanak Observatory, in Uzbekistan, from May 2004 to September 2005. The photometry is performed using simultaneous deconvolution of the data, which provides the individual light curves of the otherwise blended quasar images. The time delay is determined from the light curves using two very different numerical techniques, i.e., polynomial fitting and direct cross-correlation. The time delay is converted into H_0 following analytical modeling of the potential well. &lt;BR /&gt;Results: Our best estimate of the time delay is Delta t = 49.5 Â± 1.9 days, i.e., we reach a 3.8\% accuracy. The R-band flux ratio between the quasar images, corrected for the time delay and for slow microlensing, is F\_A/F_B = 6.2 Â± 5\%. &lt;BR /&gt;Conclusions: .The accuracy reached on the time delay allows us to discriminate well between families of lens models. As for most other multiply imaged quasars, only models of the lensing galaxy that have a de Vaucouleurs mass profile plus external shear give a Hubble constant compatible with the current most popular value (H_0 = 72 Â± 8 km s^-1 Mpc^-1). A more realistic singular isothermal sphere model plus external shear gives H_0 = 51.7^+4.0_-3.0 km s^-1 Mpc^-1.

        <abstract>We present spectroscopic and imaging observations of a candidate optical Einstein ring. The deflector is a luminous early-type galaxy, M\_B\_T=-20.9+5logh (q\_0=0.1), at redshift z=0.485. Superposed on the otherwise normal spectrum of the galaxy is a strong emission feature at 5588A. No other emission lines are evident over the wavelength range lambdalambda4456-7912A. Narrow-band imaging of the system at the emission-line wavelength reveals a semicircular arc, radius r=1.35 arcsec, centred on the peak of the galaxy surface brightness distribution. The properties of the system can be reproduced by a gravitational lens model in which the deflector has a constant mass-to-light ratio (corrected for evolution) of M/L\_B\_(0)~20h and the source is an intrinsically small, but resolved, object at high redshift, either at z=3.597 (if the line is Lyalpha lambda1216), or at z=2.607 (if the line is CIV lambda1549). Alternatives to the lensing explanation, in which the emission feature is associated with [OII] lambda3727, with a velocity difference of 2900 km s^-1 relative to the absorption-line redshift of the galaxy, appear to be extremely improbable. Unambiguous identification of the system as a gravitational lens requires the detection of a second emission line, and would confirm the system as the first Einstein ring to be discovered in the optical.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present optical and near-infrared spectroscopic observations of the optical Einstein ring 0047-2808. We detect both [O III] lines lambdalambda4959, 5007 near ~2.3mum, confirming the redshift of the lensed source as z=3.595. The Lyalpha line is redshifted relative to the [O III] line by 140Â±20kms^-1. Similar velocity shifts have been seen in nearby starburst galaxies. The [O III] line is very narrow, 130kms^-1 FWHM. If the ring is the image of the centre of a galaxy, the one-dimensional stellar velocity dispersion sigma=55kms^-1 is considerably smaller than the value predicted by Baugh et al. for the somewhat brighter Lyman-break galaxies. The Lyalpha line is significantly broader than the [O III] line, probably due to resonant scattering. The stellar central velocity dispersion of the early-type deflector galaxy at z=0.485 is 250Â±30kms^-1. This value is in good agreement both with the value predicted from the radius of the Einstein ring (and a singular isothermal sphere model for the deflector), and with the value estimated from the D\_n-sigma relation.</abstract>

        <abstract>The optical Einstein ring 0047-2808 was imaged by the VLT UT1 during the science verification programme. The ring is the image of a high-redshift z=3.595 star-forming galaxy, with strong Lyalpha emission at 5589 Angstroms, gravitationally lensed by a massive early-type galaxy at z=0.485. Relative to earlier NTT data the high signal-to-noise ratio of the VLT Lyalpha narrow-band image allows much improved constraints to be placed on the surface-brightness profile of the source and on the mass, leading to a measured mass-to-light ratio of M/L\_B ~ 13 h for the deflector galaxy. We have combined the VLT B-band and Lyalpha narrow-band images with a K-band image obtained at UKIRT to produce a deep colour image of the system.

        <abstract>We perform a detailed analysis of the optical gravitational lens ER 0047-2808 imaged with the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 on the Hubble Space Telescope. Using software specifically designed for the analysis of resolved gravitational lens systems, we focus on how the image alone can constrain the mass distribution in the lens galaxy. We find that the data are of sufficient quality to strongly constrain the lens model with no a priori assumptions about the source. Using a variety of mass models, we find statistically acceptable results for elliptical isothermal-like models with an Einstein radius of 1.17 arcsec. An elliptical power-law model (Sigma~R^-beta) for the surface mass density favours a slope slightly steeper than isothermal with beta= 1.08 Â± 0.03. Other models including a constant mass-to-light ratio (M/L), pure Navarro, Frenk amp White halo and (surprisingly) an isothermal sphere with external shear are ruled out by the data. We find the galaxy light profile can only be fit with a S'ersic plus point-source model. The resulting total M/L_B contained within the images is 4.7h_65Â± 0.3. In addition, we find the luminous matter is aligned with the total mass distribution within a few degrees. This is the first time a resolved optical gravitational lens image has been quantitatively reproduced using a non-parametric source. The source, reconstructed by the software, is revealed to have two bright regions, with an unresolved component inside the caustic and a resolved component straddling a fold caustic. The angular size of the entire source is ~0.1 arcsec and its (unlensed) Lyalpha flux is 3 x 10^-17ergs^-1cm^-2.</abstract>

        <abstract>Spectroscopic observations of the twin QSOs 0957+561 A, B obtained with the multiple-mirror telescope are presented. The spectral similarities of the two objects reported by Walsh, Carswell, and Weymann (1979) are confirmed and strengthened. In particular, the absorption-line redshifts are found to differ by 7 + or - 15 km/s. Hypotheses conventionally used to account for the origin of QSO absorption-line systems are examined, and difficulty is encountered in explaining such close agreement in the redshifts. The possibility that a gravitational lens is responsible for forming two images of a single QSO is discussed.</abstract>

        <abstract>Observations of the triple quasar PG 1115+08 suggesting its nature as a single object diffracted by a gravitational lens are reported. The object was observed in a high-resolution image tube spectroscopic survey and with the MMT spectrograph on separate occasions. Comparison of the spectra of the three quasar components and their ratios reveals them to be identical within experimental accuracy, with variable contamination of the spectra of the weaker companions by the presumed actual quasar. CCD camera images of the system indicate the total magnitude of the two lens images to be 18.1, compared to a total system magnitude of 15.8, and the image geometry of PG 1115+08A,B,C is compared with that of the previously observed gravitational-lens double quasar 0957+56A,B.</abstract>

        <abstract>Absorption lines of CO(1-2), CO(2-3), HCO^+^(1-2) and HCN(1-2) have been detected at a redshift of z_a_=0.68466 towards the background BLLac object B0218+357. The CO and HCN lines are strongly saturated, while the HCO^+^ line is mildly saturated. Lower limits to the column densities are (7.0Â±0.3)x10^16^/cm^2^ for CO, (7.4Â±0.2)x10^13^/cm^2^ for HCO^+^ and (1.4Â±0.1)x10^14^/cm^2^ for HCN. The filling factor for the background source is larger than 0.7-0.8. The absorption line profile is asymmetric with a width of ~30km/s. B0218+357 is a gravitational lens candidate with two compact continuum sources separated by 335mas (1.8kpc). The small linewidth of the molecular absorption puts constraints on the inclination and position angle of the lensing galaxy. We also report a search for QSOs molecular absorption lines in 12 other redshifted systems; none were detected.</abstract>

        <abstract>Many strong gravitational lenses lie in complex environments, such as poor groups of galaxies, that significantly bias conclusions from lens analyses. We are undertaking a photometric survey of all known galaxy-mass strong lenses to characterize their environments and include them in careful lens modeling, as well as to build a large, uniform sample of galaxy groups at intermediate redshifts for evolutionary studies. In this paper we present wide-field photometry of the environments of 12 lens systems with 0.24&amp;lt;=z_lens&amp;lt;=0.5. Using a red sequence identifying technique, we find that 8 of the 12 lenses lie in groups and that 10 group-like structures are projected along the line of sight toward 7 of these lenses. Follow-up spectroscopy of a subset of these fields confirms these results. For lenses in groups, the group centroid position is consistent with the direction of the external tidal shear required by lens models. Lens galaxies are not all super-L_* elliptical galaxies; the median lens luminosity is &amp;lt;~L_*, and the distribution of lens luminosities extends 3 mag below L_* (in agreement with theoretical models). Only two of the lenses in groups are the brightest group galaxy, in qualitative agreement with theoretical predictions. As in the local universe, the highest velocity dispersion (sigma) groups contain a brightest member spatially coincident with the group centroid, whereas lower sigma groups tend to have an offset brightest group galaxy. This suggests that higher sigma groups are more dynamically relaxed than lower sigma groups and that at least some evolved groups exist by z~0.5.</abstract>

        <abstract>SDSS J1004+4112 is an unprecedented object. It looks much like several quadruple quasars lensed by individual galaxies, only it is ~10 times larger and the lens is a cluster dominated by dark matter. We present free-form reconstructions of the lens using recently developed methods. The projected cluster mass profile is consistent with being shallow, r^-0.3 to r^-0.5, and can be fitted with either a Navarro-Frenk-White or a flat-cored three-dimensional mass distribution. However, we cannot rule out projected profiles as steep as r^-1.3. The projected mass within 100 kpc is well constrained as (5Â±1)	imes10^13 M_solar, consistent with previous simpler models. Unlike previous work, however, we are able to detect structures in the lens associated with cluster galaxies. We estimate the mass associated with these galaxies and show that they contribute not more than about 10\% of the total cluster mass within 100 kpc. Typical galaxy masses, combined with typical luminosities, yield a rough estimate of their mass-to-light ratio, which is in the single digits. Finally, we discuss implications for time-delay measurements in this system, and possibilities for a partial Einstein ring.</abstract>

        <abstract>Bright galaxy-galaxy strong lenses are much more powerful than lensed quasars for measuring the mass profiles of galaxies, but until this year only a handful have been known. Here, we present five new examples, identified via the optimal line-of-sight gravitational lens search strategy applied to luminous red galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Our survey largely complements a similar survey by Bolton et al., who recently presented several new lenses. The lensed background galaxies are selected from the SDSS spectra via the presence of narrow emission-line signatures, including the [OII] lambdalambda3726, 3729, Hbeta and [OIII] lambdalambda4960, 5008 lines, superposed on the spectra of the bright, intervening, deflector galaxies. Our five confirmed new systems include deflector galaxies with redshifts z = 0.17-0.28 and lensed galaxies with redshifts z = 0.47-1.18. Simulations of moderately deep (few orbits) Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) imaging of systems such as these, where the lensed source is brighter than r ~ 23, are presented. These demonstrate the feasibility of accurately measuring the inner slope of the dark matter halo to within an uncertainty sigma(gamma) ~ 0.1, the dark matter fraction within the Einstein radius and the mass-to-light ratio of the stars alone, independently of dynamical measurements. The high success rate of our search so far, &gt;60 per cent, and the relatively modest observational resources necessary to confirm the gravitational lens nature of the candidates, demonstrates that compilation of a sample of ~100 galaxy-galaxy lenses from the SDSS is readily achievable, opening up a rich new field in dark matter studies. Based on observations made with the William Herschel Telescope operated on the island of La Palma by the Isaac Newton Group in the Spanish Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos of the Instituto de Astrofisica de Canarias, and at the European Southern Observatory, Chile (programme ID: 075.A-0463).

        <abstract>Gravitational lensing is a potentially important probe of spiral galaxy structure, but only a few cases of lensing by spiral galaxies are known. We present Hubble Space Telescope and Magellan observations of the two-image quasar PMN J2004-1349, revealing that the lens galaxy is a spiral galaxy. One of the quasar images passes through a spiral arm of the galaxy and suffers 3 mag of V-band extinction. Using simple lens models, we show that the mass quadrupole is well aligned with the observed galaxy disk. A more detailed model with components representing the bulge and disk gives a bulge-to-disk mass ratio of 0.16Â±0.05. The addition of a spherical dark halo, tailored to produce an overall flat rotation curve, does not change this conclusion.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report the discovery of a new double-image gravitational lens, resulting from our search for lenses in the southern sky. Radio source PMN J2004-1349 is composed of two compact components separated by 1.13'' in VLA, MERLIN, and VLBA images. The components have a flux ratio of 1:1 at radio frequencies ranging from 5 to 22.5 GHz. The I-band optical counterpart is also an equal double, with roughly the same separation and position angle as the radio double. Upon subtraction of the components from the I-band image, we identify a dim pattern of residuals as the lens galaxy. While the present observations are sufficient to establish that PMN J2004-1349 is a gravitational lens, additional information will be necessary (such as the redshifts of the galaxy and quasar and precise astrometry and photometry of the lens galaxy) before constructing detailed mass models.

        <abstract>We report the discovery of a new double-image quasar that was found during a search for gravitational lenses in the southern sky. Radio source PMN J1838-3427 is composed of two flat-spectrum components with separation 1.0'', flux density ratio 14:1, and matching spectral indices in VLA and VLBA images. Ground-based BRI images show the optical counterpart (total I=18.6) is also double, with the same separation and position angle as the radio components. An HST/WFPC2 image reveals the lens galaxy. The optical flux ratio (27:1) is higher than the radio value, probably because of differential extinction of the components by the lens galaxy. An optical spectrum of the bright component contains quasar emission lines at z=2.78 and several absorption features, including prominent Lyalpha absorption. The lens galaxy redshift could not be measured, but it is estimated to be z=0.36Â±0.08. The image configuration is consistent with the simplest plausible models for the lens potential. The flat radio spectrum and observed variability of PMN J1838-3427 suggest that the time delay between flux variations of the components is measurable and could thus provide an independent measurement of H_0. Based on observations using the Very Large Array (VLA) and Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO), the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope (HST), the 3.6 m telescope of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) at La Silla, the du Pont telescope at Las Campanas Observatory (LCO), and the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA).

        <abstract>We present new Hubble Space Telescope images of the gravitational lens PKS 1830-211, which allow us to characterize the lens galaxy and update the determination of the Hubble constant (H_0) from this system. The I-band image shows that the lens galaxy is a face-on spiral galaxy with clearly delineated spiral arms. The southwestern image of the background quasar passes through one of the spiral arms, explaining the previous detections of large quantities of molecular gas and dust in front of this image. The lens galaxy photometry is consistent with the Tully-Fisher relation, suggesting the lens galaxy is a typical spiral galaxy for its redshift. The lens galaxy position, which was the main source of uncertainty in previous attempts to determine H_0, is now known precisely. Given the current time delay measurement and assuming the lens galaxy has an isothermal mass distribution, we compute H_0=44Â±9 km s^-1 Mpc^-1 for an Omega_m=0.3 flat cosmological model. We describe some possible systematic errors and how to reduce them. We also discuss the possibility raised by Courbin et al. (2002), that what we have identified as a single lens galaxy is actually a foreground star and two separate galaxies.</abstract>

        <abstract>The radio-loud quasar J0134-0931 was discovered to have an unusual morphology during our search for gravitational lenses. In Very Large Array and MERLIN images, there are five compact components with a maximum separation of 0.7''. All of these components have the same spectral index from 5 to 43 GHz. In a Very Long Baseline Array image at 1.7 GHz, a curved arc of extended emission joins two of the components in a manner suggestive of gravitational lensing. At least two of the radio components have near-infrared counterparts. We argue that this evidence implies that J0134-0931 is a gravitational lens, although we have not been able to devise a plausible model for the foreground gravitational potential. Like several other radio-loud lenses, the background source has an extraordinarily red optical counterpart.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report the discovery of a gravitationally lensed quasar resulting from our survey for lenses in the southern sky. Radio images of J1632-0033 with the Very Large Array and the Australia Telescope Compact Array exhibit two compact, flat-spectrum components with separation 1.47'' and flux density ratio 13.2. Images with the Hubble Space Telescope reveal the optical counterparts to the radio components and also the lens galaxy. An optical spectrum of the bright component obtained with the first Magellan telescope reveals quasar emission lines at redshift 3.42. Deeper radio images with the Multi-Element Radio Linked Interferometry Network and the Very Long Baseline Array reveal a faint third radio component located near the center of the lens galaxy, which is either a third image of the background quasar or faint emission from the lens galaxy.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present multifrequency VLBA2 observations of PMN J1632-0033, one of the few gravitationally lensed quasars suspected of having a central ''odd'' image. The central component has a different spectral index than the two bright quasar images. Therefore, either the central component is not a third image, and is instead the active nucleus of the lens galaxy, or else it is a third image whose spectrum is inverted by free-free absorption in the lens galaxy. In either case, we have more constraints on mass models than are usually available for a two-image lens, especially when combined with the observed orientations of the radio jets of the two bright quasars. If there is no third quasar image, the simplest permitted model is a singular isothermal sphere in an external shear field: beta=2.05^+0.23_-0.10 (2 sigma), where rho(r)~r^-beta. If the central component is a third image, a hypothesis that can be tested with future high-frequency observations, then the density distribution is only slightly shallower than isothermal: beta=1.91Â±0.02 (2 sigma). We also derive limits on the size of a constant-density core, and the break radius and exponent of an inner density cusp.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report the discovery of the new gravitational lens system HE 0230-2130, a QSO at redshift z=2.162 consisting of at least five distinct components. Three of these are clearly lensed images of the QSO, one is most likely the lensing galaxy, while for the fifth component the identity is unclear: It could be a fourth QSO image (if so, then highly reddened), or another intervening galaxy, or a superposition of the two. Differential reddening seems to be important also for the first three QSO images. The surface density of faint galaxies near the QSO appears to be enhanced by a factor of &amp;gt;~ 2, indicating the presence of a distant cluster close to the line of sight. Partly based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, La Silla, Chile.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report the discovery of a bright double QSO at a redshift of 2.303, separated by 3 seconds, with B magnitudes of 16.70 and 18.64, respectively. Spectrophotometry reveals distinct differences betwen A and B: component A has a harder continuum but, relative to the continuum, weaker emission lines than B. However, f_lambda(A) - 2.8 f_lambda(B) yields a nearly featureless continuum, i.e., the emission line flux ratios and line profiles are identical in A and B. The observed differences are tentatively interpreted as a combination of image splitting by a macrolens with a magnification ratio of A/B = 2.8 with additional microlensing of the quasar continuum source in the brighter image. This would cause a chromatic dependence of amplification if the size of the continuum emitting region varies with wavelength. The influence on the much larger broad emission line region is small and possibly seen only in the far Lyman alpha wing. No galaxy in the line of sight brighter than R = 24 could be detected. However, component A has a damped Lyman alpha (plus Mg II, Fe II, C IV...) absorption system at z = 1.66 which in B appears only in C IV. A further Mg II system at z = 1.32 is also seen only in A. The z = 1.66 system, possibly caused by a galactic disk in the line of sight of A, might be related to the proposed microlensing. Alternatively, the pair might be a binary QSO. The macro- plus microlensing hypothesis can be tested by long-term spectrophotometric monitoring.</abstract>

        <abstract>We announce the discovery of a new bright gravitionally lensed QSO, HE 2149-2745. The object at z=2.033 presents two images separated by 1.7'', with B magnitudes 17.3 and 19.0, respectively. Their spectra look identical within the measurement errors; in particular, both components display indistinguishable P Cygni-type emission/absorption complexes. Near to the line of sight to the brighter component, an extended source with R~19.8 is detected which could be responsible for the lensing. If it is a luminous galaxy (L~L*), we infer a probable redshift range of ~0.2-0.5.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report the discovery of a new gravitationally lensed QSO, at a redshift z = 1.689, with four QSO components in a cross-shaped arrangement around a bright galaxy. The maximum separation between images is 2farcs 6, enabling a reliable decomposition of the system. Three of the QSO components have g =~ 19.6, while component A is about 0.6 mag brighter. The four components have nearly identical colours, suggesting little if any dust extinction in the foreground galaxy. The lensing galaxy is prominent in the i band, weaker in r and not detected in g. Its spatial profile is that of an elliptical galaxy with a scale length of ~ 12 kpc. Combining the measured colours and a mass model for the lens, we estimate a most likely redshift range of 0.3 &amp;lt; z &amp;lt; 0.4. Predicted time delays between the components are la 10 days. The QSO shows evidence for variability, with total g band magnitudes of 17.89 and 17.71 for two epochs separated by ~ 2 months. However, the relative fluxes of the components did not change, indicating that the variations are intrinsic to the QSO rather than induced by microlensing. Based in part on observations obtained with the Baade 6.5-m telescope of the Magellan Consortium.

        <abstract>The quasar HE 0047-1756, at z=1.67, is found to be split into two images 1.44 arcsec apart by an intervening galaxy acting as a gravitational lens. The flux ratio for the two components is roughly 3.5:1, depending slightly upon wavelength. The lensing galaxy is seen on images obtained in the i (800 nm) and K_s bands (2.1 mum); there is also a nearby faint object which may be responsible for some shear. The spectra of the two quasar images are nearly identical, but the emission line ratio between the two components scale differently from the continuum. Moreover, the fainter component has a bluer continuum slope than the brighter one. We argue that these small differences are probably due to microlensing. There is evidence for a partial Einstein ring emanating from the brighter image toward the fainter one.

        <abstract>B0218+357 is one of the most promising systems to determine the Hubble constant from time-delays in gravitational lenses. Consisting of two bright images, which are well resolved in very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations, plus one of the most richly structured Einstein rings, it potentially provides better constraints for the mass model than most other systems. The main problem left until now was the very poorly determined position of the lensing galaxy. After presenting detailed results from classical lens modelling, we apply our improved version of the LENSCLEAN algorithm which for the first time utilizes the beautiful Einstein ring for lens modelling purposes. The primary result using isothermal lens models is a now very well defined lens position of (255 Â± 6, 119 Â± 4) mas relative to the A image, which allows the first reliable measurement of the Hubble constant from the time-delay of this system. The result of H_0= (78 Â± 6) km s^-1 Mpc^-1 (2sigma) is very high compared with other lenses. It is, however, compatible with local estimates from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) key project and with WMAP results, but less prone to systematic errors. We furthermore discuss possible changes of these results for different radial mass profiles and find that the final values cannot be very different from the isothermal expectations. The power-law exponent of the potential is constrained by VLBI data of the compact images and the inner jet to be beta= 1.04 Â± 0.02, which confirms that the mass distribution is approximately isothermal (corresponding to beta= 1), but slightly shallower. The effect on H_0 is reduced from the expected 4 per cent decrease by an estimated shift of the best galaxy position of circa 4 mas to at most 2 per cent. Maps of the unlensed source plane produced from the best LENSCLEAN brightness model show a typical jet structure and allow us to identify the parts which are distorted by the lens to produce the radio ring. We also present a composite map which for the first time shows the rich structure of B0218+357 on scales ranging from mas to arcsec, both in the image plane and in the reconstructed source plane. Finally, we use a comparison of observations at different frequencies to investigate the question of possible weakening of one of the images by propagation effects and/or source shifts with frequency. The data clearly favour the model of significant 'extinction' without noticeable source position shifts. The technical details of our variant of the LENSCLEAN method are presented in the accompanying Paper I.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present the first separate spectra of both components of the small-separation double QSO &lt;ASTROBJ&gt;HE 0512-3329&lt;/ASTROBJ&gt; obtained with HST/STIS in the optical and near UV. The similarities especially of the emission line profiles and redshifts strongly suggest that this system really consists of two lensed images of one and the same source. The emission line flux ratios are assumed to be unaffected by microlensing and are used to study the differential extinction effects caused by the lensing galaxy. Fits of empirical laws show that the extinction properties seem to be different on both lines of sight. With our new results, &lt;ASTROBJ&gt;HE 0512-3329&lt;/ASTROBJ&gt; becomes one of the few extragalactic systems which show the 2175 \AA absorption feature, although the detection is only marginal. We then correct the continuum flux ratio for extinction to obtain the differential microlensing signal. Since this may still be significantly affected by variability and time-delay effects, no detailled analysis of the microlensing is possible at the moment. This is the first time that differential extinction and microlensing could be separated unambiguously. We show that, at least in &lt;ASTROBJ&gt;HE 0512-3329&lt;/ASTROBJ&gt;, both effects contribute significantly to the spectral differences and one cannot be analysed without taking into account the other. For lens modelling purposes, the flux ratios can only be used after correcting for both effects.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report the discovery of a new double-image gravitational lens system, B1030+074, which was found during the Jodrell Bank-VLA Astrometric Survey (JVAS). We have collected extensive radio data on the system using the VLA, MERLIN, the EVN and the VLBA, and optical observations using WFPC2 on the HST. The lensed images are separated by 1.56 arcsec and their flux density ratio at centimetric wavelengths is approximately 14:1, although the ratio is slightly frequency-dependent and the images appear to be time-variable. The HST pictures show both the lensed images and the lensing galaxy close to the weaker image. The lensing galaxy has substructure which could be a spiral arm or an interacting galaxy. We have modelled B1030+074 using a singular isothermal ellipsoid which yields a time delay of 156/h_50 d. This lens is likely to be suitable for the measurement of the Hubble constant.</abstract>

        <abstract>We use the structure of the Einstein ring image of the quasar host galaxy in the four-image quasar lens PG 1115+080 to determine the angular structure of the gravitational potential of the lens galaxy. We find that it is well described as an ellipsoid and that the best-fit nonellipsoidal models are consistent with the ellipsoidal model. We find upper limits on the standard parameters for the deviation from an ellipse of |a^B_3/a_0|&amp;lt;0.035 and |a^B_4/a_0|&amp;lt;0.064. We also find that the position of the center of mass is consistent with the center of light, with an upper limit of |Deltax|&amp;lt;0.005'' on the offset between them. Neither the ellipsoidal nor the nonellipsoidal models can reproduce the observed image flux ratios while simultaneously maintaining a reasonable fit to the Einstein ring, so the anomalous flux ratio of the A_1 and A_2 quasar images must be due to substructure in the gravitational potential such as compact satellite galaxies or stellar microlenses rather than odd angular structure in the lens galaxy. Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555.</abstract>

        <abstract>We report on the discovery of the new gravitational lens system CLASS B0631+519. Imaging with the Very Large Array, the Multi-Element Radio-Linked Interferometer Network (MERLIN) and the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) reveals a doubly imaged flat-spectrum radio core, a doubly imaged steep-spectrum radio lobe and possible quadruply imaged emission from a second lobe. The maximum separation between the lensed images is 1.16 arcsec. High-resolution mapping with the VLBA at 5 GHz resolves the most magnified image of the radio core into a number of subcomponents spread across approximately 20 mas. No emission from the lensing galaxy or an odd image is detected down to 0.31 mJy (5sigma) at 8.4 GHz. Optical and near-infrared imaging with the Advanced Camera for Surveys and the Near-Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) show that there are two galaxies along the line of sight to the lensed source, as previously discovered by optical spectroscopy. We find that the foreground galaxy at z= 0.0896 is a small irregular, and that the other, at z= 0.6196 is a massive elliptical, which appears to contribute the majority of the lensing effect. The host galaxy of the lensed source is detected in the HST near-infrared imaging as a set of arcs, which form a nearly complete Einstein ring. Mass modelling using non-parametric techniques can reproduce the near-infrared observations and indicates that the small irregular galaxy has a (localized) effect on the flux density distribution in the Einstein ring at the 5-10 per cent level.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present deep optical observations of the gravitational lens system CLASS B0218+357, from which we derive an estimate for the Hubble constant (H_0). Extensive radio observations using the VLA, MERLIN, the VLBA and VLBI have reduced the degeneracies between H_0 and the mass model parameters in this lens to one involving only the position of the radio-quiet lensing galaxy with respect to the lensed images. B0218+357 has an image separation of only 334 mas, so optical observations have, up until now, been unable to resolve the lens galaxy from the bright lensed images. Using the new Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS), installed on the Hubble Space Telescope in 2002, we have obtained deep optical images of the lens system and surrounding field. These observations have allowed us to determine the separation between the lens galaxy centre and the brightest image, and so estimate H_0. We find an optical galaxy position, and hence an H_0 value, that varies depending on our approach to the spiral arms in B0218+357. If the most prominent spiral arms are left unmasked, we find H_0= 70 Â± 5 km s^-1 Mpc^-1 (95 per cent confidence). If the spiral arms are masked out, we find H_0= 61 Â± 7 km s^-1 Mpc^-1 (95 per cent confidence).</abstract>

        <abstract>We identify the largest known lensed images of a single spiral galaxy, lying close to the center of the distant cluster MACS J1149.5+2223 (z = 0.544). These images cover a total area of ~e 150" and are magnified ~e200 times. Unusually, there is very little image distortion, implying that the central mass distribution is almost uniform over a wide area (r ~e 200 kpc) with a surface density equal to the critical density for lensing, corresponding to maximal lens magnification. Many fainter multiply lensed galaxies are also uncovered by our model, outlining a very large tangential critical curve, of radius r ~e 170 kpc, posing a potential challenge for the standard LCDM cosmology. Because of the uniform central mass distribution, a particularly clean measurement of the mass of the brightest cluster galaxy is possible here, for which we infer stars contribute most of the mass within a limiting radius of ~e30 kpc, with a mass-to-light ratio of M/L_B ~e 4.5(M/L)_sun. This cluster with its uniform and central mass distribution acts analogously to a regular magnifying glass, converging light without distorting the images, resulting in the most powerful lens yet discovered for accessing the faint high-z universe.</abstract>

        <abstract>We present the results of a strong-lensing analysis of a complete sample of 12 very luminous X-ray clusters at z &amp;gt; 0.5 using HST/ACS images. Our modelling technique has uncovered some of the largest known critical curves outlined by many accurately predicted sets of multiple images. The distribution of Einstein radii has a median value of ~e28 arcsec (for a source redshift of z_s\tilde 2), twice as large as other lower z samples, and extends to 55 arcsec for MACS J0717.5+3745, with an impressive enclosed Einstein mass of 7.4 \times 10^14 M_â. We find that nine clusters cover a very large area (&amp;gt;2.5 arcmin^2) of high magnification (mu &amp;gt; 10\times) for a source redshift of z_s\tilde 8, providing primary targets for accessing the first stars and galaxies. We compare our results with theoretical predictions of the standard Lambda cold dark matter (LambdaCDM) model which we show systematically fall short of our measured Einstein radii by a factor of ~e1.4, after accounting for the effect of lensing projection. Nevertheless, a revised analysis, once arc redshifts become available, and similar analyses of larger samples, is needed in order to establish more precisely the level of discrepancy with LambdaCDM predictions.</abstract>

        <abstract>We identify 13 sets of multiply-lensed galaxies around MACS J0717.5+3745 (z = 0.546), outlining a very large tangential critical curve of major axis ~2farcm8, filling the field of the Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced Camera for Surveys. The equivalent circular Einstein radius is \thetas_ e  = 55'' \Â± 3'' (at an estimated source redshift of z_s ~ 2.5), corresponding to r_e sime 350 \Â± 20 kpc at the cluster redshift, nearly three times greater than that of A1689 (r_e sime 140 kpc for z_s = 2.5). The mass enclosed by this critical curve is very large, 7.4 \Â± 0.5 \\times 10^14 M _sun and only weakly model dependent, with a relatively shallow mass profile within r \&lt; 250 kpc, reflecting the unrelaxed appearance of this cluster. This shallow profile generates a much higher level of magnification than the well-known relaxed lensing clusters of higher concentration, so that the area of sky exceeding a magnification of \&gt;10 times, is sime3.5squ' for sources with z sime 8, making MACS J0717.5+3745 a compelling target for accessing faint objects at high redshift. We calculate that only one such cluster, with \thetas_ e  \&gt;= 55'', is predicted within ~10^7 Universes with z \&gt;= 0.55, corresponding to a virial mass \&gt;=3 \\times 10^15 M _sun, for the standard \LambdaCDM (WMAP5 parameters with 2\sigma uncertainties).</abstract>

        <abstract>We present a strong-lensing analysis of the galaxy cluster MACS J1206.2-0847 (z = 0.44) using UV, Optical, and IR, HST/ACS/WFC3 data taken as part of the CLASH multi-cycle treasury program, with VLT/VIMOS spectroscopy for some of the multiply lensed arcs. The CLASH observations, combined with our mass model, allow us to identify 47 new multiply lensed images of 12 distant sources. These images, along with the previously known arc, span the redshift range 1 &amp;lt;~ z &amp;lt;~ 5.5, and thus enable us to derive a detailed mass distribution and to accurately constrain, for the first time, the inner mass profile of this cluster. We find an inner profile slope of dlog Sigma/dlog thetas ~= -0.55 Â± 0.1 (in the range [1'', 53''], or 5 kpc &amp;lt;~ r &amp;lt;~ 300 kpc), as commonly found for relaxed and well-concentrated clusters. Using the many systems uncovered here we derive credible critical curves and Einstein radii for different source redshifts. For a source at z_s ~= 2.5, the critical curve encloses a large area with an effective Einstein radius of thetas_ E  = 28'' Â± 3'', and a projected mass of (1.34 Â± 0.15) \times 10^14 M _â. From the current understanding of structure formation in concordance cosmology, these values are relatively high for clusters at z ~ 0.5, so that detailed studies of the inner mass distribution of clusters such as MACS J1206.2-0847 can provide stringent tests of the LambdaCDM paradigm.</abstract>
